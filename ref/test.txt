Cleveland came out with purpose in the first half , wining both of the first two quarters to go into the break with 57 - 36 lead . Coach David Blatt could have taken the game easy with the Cavs up 30 in the series , but he opted to push the accelerator to the floor and used his big guns for most of the game to ensure a win and an end to the Cavs ' first - round series . LeBron James played a team - high 46 minutes and was followed closely by Kyrie Irving with 43 minutes of his own . Kevin Love was forced from the game in the first quarter with what appeared to be a dislocated left shoulder after Celtics big man Kelly Olynyk appeared to pull down on Love 's arm while fighting for a rebound . Love was n't the only player to be forced from the game , and the Love/Olynyk incident was n't the only physical altercation . In the second quarter , Kendrick Perkins put a hard screen on Jae Crowder , pushing Crowder in his face and forcing him to the ground before antagonizing Crowder with a tap to the face with a closed fist . Both Perkins and Crowder were assessed technical fouls , and Perkins earned a flagrant - 1 foul for the tap to Crowder 's face . Shortly after halftime , Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith . Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result . Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain , unable to return . The Celtics made a run in the third quarter , outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window , but it was n't enough . Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game . The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals , and they 'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage . Kevin Love 's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team 's doctors . Smith and Perkins appear in line for suspensions , and a judgment on their statuses will likely be handed down before the start of the conference semifinals .

Washington ended a short , but important two game losing skid with an easy victory on the road , and are now 3 games back of the Detroit Pistons for the 8 - seed in the Eastern Conference . The Wizards played at a high speed pace , led by John Wall , who diced through the Lakers defense and took advantage of his matchup with D’Angelo Russell . Wall’s 22 points , 13 assists and five rebounds overshadowed his seven turnovers , which proved to be a non - issue seeing the double digit lead his team held for most of the game . The former No . 1 overall pick ran impressive sets with Marcin Gortat , who was on the receiving end of multiple flashy dimes , and turned in 16 points and 10 rebounds . The Lakers got into early foul trouble and ended up with a total of 26 team fouls , but the Wizards shot a poor 16 - of - 29 from the free throw line . Given the amount of times that Los Angeles put Washington on the line , the 13 points loss could well have been a 20 - plus point blowout . D’Angelo Russell was no match defending Wall from getting to the rim , but he did equal his opponents scoring with 22 points of his own . Kobe Bryant has a handful of games left in his career , and the wear and tear of his 20th season reared it’s head a few times during the game .

Both teams had locked up their playoff spots before this game , but we now know for sure who each will play . The Wizards will take on the Toronto Raptors in the first round , while the Cavaliers will play the Boston Celtics .

Tristan Thompson was the other bench player to reach double figures . In 21 minutes , he finished with 12 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) and eight rebounds , boosting his April averages to 7 points and 8 rebounds per game over 23 minutes . Playing just 18 minutes with the starters , Kevin Love was still very efficient with his time and chipped in with 19 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 5 - 6 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and three rebounds before getting most of the night off for rest . Like the Cavaliers , the Wizards rested the majority of their players , as John Wall , Bradley Beal and Paul Pierce were all held out of this matchup . It was Martell Webster who had the biggest outing , as he came off the bench for 20 points ( 5 - 9 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt , 7 - 8 FT ) and three rebounds over 36 minutes . The 20 points were a new season - high for the forward , as he had yet to break double figures in points during this season . Rasual Butler was another reason the Wizards were able to keep this game close . He finished with 17 points ( 7 - 19 FG , 3 - 8 3Pt ) , seven rebounds and two steals , while playing 45 minutes . It was a nice end to the season for Butler , who finishes the year with averages of 8 points and 3 rebounds over 74 games . Both Kevin Seraphin and Ramon Sessions reached double figures in points as well . Seraphin recorded 12 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 0 - 1 FT ) , 12 rebounds and three blocked shots , while Sessions added 14 points ( 4 - 8 FG , 2 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) and six assists .

The Nuggets had a season - high 21 - point lead in the second quarter , but managed to choke that away . They let the Lakers go on a 23 - 3 run between the second and third quarter and could never recover after that .

The one bright spot was the bench , as all four players who came off the bench scored at least nine points while accumulating 58 points all together .

This was a brutal loss for Nuggets fans and they 'll look to bounce - back on Wednesday when they take on the Phoenix Suns .

He 's now averaging 15 points and 6 rebounds on the year . Also getting a piece of the action was Eric Bledsoe , who had a great night shooting the ball to finish with 18 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and nine assists . It was his second strong showing in a row , as he 's combined for 37 points and 12 assists over his last two games .

Warren had a breakout performance and scored 17 points ( 8 - 10 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) in just 19 minutes .

Kevin Martin did his best to keep the Timberwolves in this game . He went 5 - for - 8 from the field and 6 - for - 7 from the free throw line to score a team - high of 16 points . After shooting just 25 percent ( 2 - 8 FG ) from the field in Monday 's game against the Clippers , it was good to see him hit on such a high percentage of shots Wednesday . In a solid performance off the bench , Justin Hamilton went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a season - high of 15 points , while also adding three rebounds and two blocked shots . It was a nice surprise for the Timberwolves , as he averages just 3 points per game and has reached double - digit points in just one other game this season . With Kevin Garnett sitting out on a night of rest , Adreian Payne moved back into the starting lineup for the fourth time this season . In 29 minutes , he finished with 10 points ( 3 - 9 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) and three rebounds . Andrew Wiggins did n't have much of an impact either , as he also had just 10 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt ) and four rebounds .

Though Utah shot just 41 percent from the field , they ran away with the game by winning the turnover battle by a huge margin , surrendering the ball just seven times to the Sixers’ 18 giveaways . Rodney Hood and Alec Burks led the backcourt with 17 and 15 points , respectively , while Derrick Favors secured a double - double with 20 points and 12 boards to accompany three steals and two blocks .

The chief offender was star center Nerlens Noel , who accrued just eight points while going 2 - for - 12 from the field . Philadelphia’s immense struggles earned a chorus of boos from the home crowd at multiple points in the game , a development unsurprising given the lack of progress the team has made since embarking on its massive rebuilding effort a couple years ago . Up next for Utah is a date with the Indiana Pacers in the second game of a road back - to - back set .

The Raptors stars really struggled shooting , as Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan combined to go 12 - of - 36 in the loss .

With Jonas Valanciunas out of the lineup with a knee contusion , Toronto really struggled down low .

All eyes were on fourth overall pick Kristaps Porzingus , who did not disappoint in his NBA regular season debut for the Knicks , scoring 16 points and adding five rebounds .

In an overtime thriller in London , DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry played as if they 'd left their shots back across the Atlantic , going a combined 9 - for - 39 from the field . Meanwhile , the Magic duo of Victor Oladipo and Evan Fournier caught fire , particularly in the second half , to drain 18 of their 31 field - goal attempts . However , despite a game - high 27 points , Oladipo could n't find the net when he needed it most , missing a 27 - foot three - point jumper with two seconds left that almost certainly would 've given the Magic a 98 - 96 victory . He then subsequently lost the handle on a drive to the basket with 2 seconds left in overtime as he attempted to tie the game at 105 , essentially sealing Orlando 's fate . Lowry did manage to lead the Raptors with 24 points despite the subpar shooting performance , as he was able to drain 12 of 14 attempts from the charity stripe .

Corey Joseph led the way with 19 points , four assists , three rebounds and a pair of steals over a robust 36 minutes , while Bismack Biyombo and Patrick Patterson pitched in with a pair of 11 - point outings . The latter 's scoring partly consisted of a trio of three - pointers , which tied him with Scola for the team lead in that category on the afternoon .

Oladipo 's 27 points were supplemented by six rebounds , six assists and a pair of steals . Fournier was right on his heels with 21 points , three assists , three rebounds and a steal . Nikola Vucevic posted a 17 - point , 11 - rebound double - double , which he complemented with four assists and three blocks .

Jason Smith was outstanding off the bench in the first half for Orlando with 16 points , but came up empty scoring - wise in the second half and the extra period . He did add five rebounds , four assists and a block . The Magic fell to 20 - 19 and remain in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They take the long trip back home to face off against the division - leading Atlanta Hawks on Monday .

The Kings took care of business on their home court en route to their 30th win of the season , which marked the first time since 2007 - 2008 , but the a bizarre final 10 seconds of play resulted in a double technical at the expense of Rajon Rondo and DeMarcus Cousins . Following a Wizards bucket , Rondo and Cousins appeared to mock the refs , walking towards their bench both clapping simultaneously . Rondo was then ejected for arguing with the ref , and Cousins earned his 16th technical foul of the season . If all holds up , both players will likely be suspended for their next game . Despite the strange ending , the Kings had little trouble handling their opponent on the second game of a back - to - back for Washington .

Beal added 24 points , three rebounds and four assists , while also providing a highlight of his handles after taking advantage of the flat footed Willie Cauley-Stein for a pretty crossover . Most of Porter Jr’s 20 points came in the third quarter , but his shooting was efficient after going 8 - of - 11 from the field . The Wizards out - rebounded and out - assisted the Kings , but even after shooting 48 percent from the field , it was not enough to match the Kings lights out 56 percent shooting as a unit . Both teams will suit up on Friday , as the Kings will host the MIami Heat ( 43 - 30 ) , while the Wizards visit the Phoenix Suns ( 20 - 55 ) .

Both the Clippers and Celtics control the 4 - seed in their respective conferences , but Los Angeles proved once again that the elite teams in the Western Conference are more overpowering than the elite teams in the Eastern Conference . Isiah Thomas and company physically battled their way through the first quarter , but still came out six points down , and the Clippers simply built on their lead during the rest of the game . Thomas chased down Chris Paul in transition for a highlight block , but it did not get any prettier than that for his team .

Jamal Crawford , Jeff Green , Wesley Johnson and Austin Rivers all finished in double figures , while Chris Paul dished out 14 assists and DeAndre Jordan commanded the paint and added 13 rebounds . Shot selection was key for the bench roles , as Los Angeles drained 52 percent of their shots and dished out 29 assists . Paul’s assist total matched that of the entire Celtics team .

The all - star point guard finished with 24 points to lead all scorers ( 5 - of - 14 FG , 12 - of - 13 FT ) and two assists . Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart were the only other Celtics to join Thomas in double figures , which was unsurprising given the defensive effort and size they were matched up against . Boston shot a lowly 35 percent from the field and got very little production from their bench . The Clippers will visit the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 25 - 49 ) on Wednesday , while the Celtics will head north to take on the Portland Trail Blazers ( 39 - 36 ) on Thursday .
The Oklahoma City Thunder ( 21 - 10 ) defeated the Denver Nuggets ( 12 - 19 ) 122 - 112 on Sunday night . The final scoreline indicates a double - digit win , but the game was tight throughout .

Both Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant were on point tonight and once again carried them to a win . Westbrook flirted with a triple - double , as he amassed 30 points , 12 assists and nine rebounds , while Durant totaled 26 points , 10 assists and five rebounds . When these two are playing like that , this is one of the three best teams in the NBA . Enes Kanter also had a great game off the bench , tallying 21 points and eight rebounds on an efficient 7 - of - 8 shooting from the field and from the free - throw line .

The San Antonio Spurs ( 48 - 9 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 24 - 32 ) 108 - 92 at Sleep Train Arena on Wednesday . Tony Parker’s 23 points were good enough to lead all scorers in the contest , and his impressive shot selection made his 11 - of - 17 shooting from the field look easy . Parker added six assists and three rebounds to his all around strong performance , one that flashed his brilliant basketball IQ , especially when finding Danny Green around the perimeter or Kawhi Leonard in transition . Unsurprisingly , the Spurs shared the ball in selfless fashion , as marked by their team 's total of 26 assists . Leonard was originally listed as questionable with a calf injury entering Wednesday morning , but still started and logged 28 minutes of game time , as he contributed 18 points , one assist and seven rebounds in the well rounded performance . The Spurs shot 52 percent from the field as a unit , and had no trouble handling DeMarcus Cousins during the first half , specifically the second quarter , where they held the Kings to only 14 points and entered the half with a double figure lead . The Spurs will play the second game of a back - to - back on the road against the Utah Jazz ( 28 - 28 ) on Thursday . DeMarcus Cousins was both the reason the Kings were out of the game in the first half , and right back in the contest during the second half . Cousins failed to register a basket in his first 10 attempts , and if not for Rajon Rondo’s supreme passing ability , the double figure lead that the Spurs entered the half with could have been much worse . Cousins stormed out in the third quarter , leading his unit to outscore the Spurs by five points in the third quarter alone , but it was not enough for a comeback to be kept within striking distance . The Kentucky big man finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds on 8 - of - 23 shooting . Rondo was given miles of space to shoot the ball , but shied away from the opportunity in favor of finding the open man , even if it meant threading the needle to do so . The league’s best passing point guard upped his leading assists per game statistic after registering 18 dimes , to go along with seven points and eight rebounds . Rudy Gay and Quincy Acy were on the receiving end of many of Rondo’s assists , as both front court players contributed double figures . The Kings will host the Los Angeles Clippers ( 37 - 20 ) on Friday .
The Los Angeles Clippers ( 11 - 9 ) defeated the Orlando Magic ( 11 - 8 ) 103 - 101 on Saturday at Staples Center . Jamal Crawford busted out of his shooting slump after scoring 32 points on 10 - of - 19 from the field in the winning effort . Crawford was essential in leading the Clippers’ comeback after trailing 91 - 80 . A pair of 3 - pointers , in addition to a driving , finger roll layup was enough to overtake the lead with just over two minutes remaining in the 4th quarter . Blake Griffin added a clutch jump shot from the free throw line down the stretch and finished with 28 points , 13 rebounds and seven assists in 39 minutes . DeAndre Jordan dominated the glass adding 14 rebounds and 15 points . The Clippers were without point guard Chris Paul ( ribs ) and looked sloppy on the offensive end at times behind fill in starter , Austin Rivers , who contributed five points and four rebounds . The Magic played a pesky defensive game and saw effective performances from young players Victor Oladipo and Elfrid Payton , as the backcourt finished with a combined 45 points . The Magic were unable to get a good look down the stretch and had no answer for Jamal Crawford’s lights out shooting , even after taking a double digit lead in the 4th quarter . Tobias Harris and Nikola Vucevic added 10 points each , while Channing Frye and Evan Fournier were unable to find a rhythm , finishing with three points and seven points , respectively . Aaron Gordon finished with 10 points in 21 minutes off the bench , to go along with seven rebounds on 5 - of - 8 shooting .

The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the visiting Golden State Warriors , 120 - 108 , in Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinals Saturday at Moda Center to climb back into the series , 2 - 1 . There was no shortage of impressive shooting in Game 3 , as the Trail Blazers received a needed offensive explosion from Damian Lillard , Al-Farouq Aminu and C.J . McCollum , who combined to keep the Warriors at bay all game long . Golden State jumped out to an early lead in the first quarter , but the Blazers bounced back and outscored the league’s best team in the second period 36 - 18 . Lillard finished the first half with 25 points , and was quiet in the third quarter before returning to for a typical lights out fourth quarter showing . Aminu was deadly from the field , and was nearly perfect through the game , but his biggest moment came after a corner three , which he completed , turned to Stephen Curry ( knee ) and stared him down as he walked back on defense late in the game . Curry sat out of practice , but is still nearing a return . Head Coach Steve Kerr said that Curry has a slight chance to play in Game 4 , but with that is dependent on the situation after Game 3 . The Warriors , who from the box score seemed like the game would have been closer than it was , saw Klay Thompson and Draymond Green really step up . Thompson and Lillard were trading threes for most of the game and both were able to finish at the rim , create off the dribble and pull up off screen and rolls . Thompson added 35 points on 14 - of - 28 shooting , while Green stuffed the stat sheet with 37 points ( including eight three - pointers ) , nine rebounds , eight assists , one steal and one block . Shaun Livingston added five points and 10 assists in place of Curry , and the bench was kept quiet for most of the game , save for Leandro Barbosa’s 10 points . Lillard and McCollum combined for 62 points , 10 rebounds and 14 assists on an 22 - of - 45 shooting . Aminu contributed 23 points and 10 boards on 8 - of - 9 shooting and was perfect through three quarters of action . The Blazers shot 57 percent from behind the arc , which eclipsed the Warriors mark by almost 10 percentage points . Game 4 will take place at Moda Center on Monday .
Thursday 's contest between the Pacers and Timberwolves all came down to whose role players could produce more . With each team 's big three having very productive nights , the deciding factor between the two teams ended up being what everyone else could do . For the Pacers , Paul George , Myles Turner and Jeff Teague produced 75 points , while Karl-Anthony Towns , Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine combined for 77 points for the Timberwolves , making the trios essentially dead even . And while neither side got anything noteworthy from any other player , be it a starter or a reserve , the ability of Indiana 's role players to put up 34 points to Minnesota 's 26 gave the game to the Pacers . Additionally , it is worth noting that both teams rank in the bottom - half of the NBA in bench scoring per game , with the Timberwolves ranking dead last .
The San Antonio Spurs ( 33 - 19 ) defeated the Indiana Pacers ( 20 - 33 ) , 95 - 93 , on Monday . The Spurs avoided losing back - to - back games once again , and have only lost to one opponent with a sub .500 record since the beginning of January . Matt Bonner got the start for San Antonio , after playing just 18 seconds in Sunday 's 87 - 82 loss at the hands of the Toronto Raptors . He logged 12 minutes this time around but was the only Spur not to score a point . Head coach Gregg Popovich reached a milestone with the victory , achieving his 1000th win . With a grand under his belt , he and the Spurs will turn their attention to the Detroit Pistons , the lone team under .500 to beat them thus far in 2015 . The Pacers ' George Hill almost spoiled the party for Popovich and his former team . Hill missed a three - pointer with less than a second remaining that would have given his team a buzzer - beating game - winner at home . The contest had been tied when Indiana gave up a Marco Belinelli bucket with two seconds left , leaving Hill with limited time to try and win the game . The Spurs will continue their road trip Wednesday against the Detroit Pistons . Meanwhile , the Pacers will travel to New Orleans to face off with the Pelicans on Wednesday .
The Utah Jazz ( 16 - 20 ) defeated the Miami Heat 98 - 83 in a slow - paced game on Saturday night With a score like that , most people would assume that the shooting was terrible , but that wasn’t the case . The Jazz actually shot 55 percent from the field , but took just 71 shots in total . The Heat shot 42 percent on 82 attempts and the teams combined for just 35 free - throws . Those are surprisingly low numbers considering the shooting percentages and it was clear the teams wanted to go to their primary identities and slow the game down to rely on their defenses . The Heat took a 10 - point lead after the first quarter , but the Jazz really turned it on after that . In fact , they held Miami to just 54 points in the final three quarters and outscored them by 25 points . The Heat came into this in the second half of a back - to - back and it clearly hampered them here . They got off to a hot start , but didn’t have the legs late to pull out a win against a defensively potent team . Dwyane Wade notoriously struggles in back - to - backs and that was the case here , as he shot just 3 - for - 17 to accumulate eight points , five rebounds and four assists . Chris Bosh had a nice game though , as he tallied 24 points and seven rebounds against a dominant frontline . The passing was a big problem for Miami , as the Heat recorded just 14 assists in the loss . It wo n't get any easier in their next game , as they have to travel to Oakland to take on a Golden State Warriors team that has just two losses on Monday . Utah got back to what they do best here and stifled the Heat en route to a big win . The star of the night was Gordon Hayward , who scored 34 points in a fantastic performance . Chris Johnson made a spot start here for the injured Rodney Hood and played great , accumulating 14 points , four rebounds , three assists , two blocks and two steals in 31 minutes . Rudy Gobert got his first start in quite some time as well and swatted away four shots despite failing to reach double - figures in points or rebounds . Injuries have really been hurting this team , but the more healthy they get , the scary they 're getting . This is the front end of a back - to - back , as the Jazz will play the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday in their next game .
The Golden State Warriors defeated the host Los Angeles Lakers , 109 - 85 , on Friday at Staple Center . This was the second game of a home - and - home series between the Lakers and Warriors that resulted in two wins for the Warriors .

Marcus Morris chipped in 15 points , while John Leuer was solid off the bench , with 15 points of his own . The Pistons ' bench accounted for 36 points on the evening and provided the boost they needed to pull away from the Nuggets .

The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 111 - 80 at Staple Center on Wednesday . The matchup was never close . The Clippers ( 7 - 1 ) took a 20 points lead at the end of the first quarter and simply built upon the Blazers ( 5 - 4 ) shooters being unable to bury a shot from the low post , to the midrange and behind the arc . It was not a particularly spectacular defensive effort by Los Angeles , rather the matchup advantage of Chris Paul on Damian Lillard . The Blazers point guard was ice cold , as he finished just 1 - of - 10 from the field and 0 - of - 4 from three point territory . The rest of the Portland team was unable to bail out the rough performance from Lillard , as C.J . McCollum and Maurice Harkless matched their starting point guard with eight points in the loss . Los Angeles , on the other hand , did not need any form of expert shooting to build upon an early lead , but did turn in effective performances from their starters .

The Rockets held Orlando to just 42 percent from the field , 69 percent from the free - throw line and 35 percent from three - point range . The Rockets really turned it on in the second half , as they outscored the Magic , 56 - 41 in that 24 - minute stretch . The assist - to - turnover ratio was decisive , with Houston recording eight more assists and the same amount of turnovers as the Magic .

The Warriors now have a 3 - 2 lead in the series and a ton of momentum following this dominating performance . With Grizzlies ' defensive specialist Tony Allen sidelined with a hamstring injury , Klay Thompson was able to take advantage of a lesser defeneder and lead the Warriors to the victory . He went 7 - for - 16 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 21 points , while also adding four rebounds and five assists . Thompson is dialed in from deep right now , combining to go 9 - for - 16 from the three - point line over his last three games . Fellow superstar and MVP Stephen Curry also played a huge factor in this game . Curry finished with 18 points ( 6 - 16 FG , 6 - 13 3Pt ) , seven rebounds , five assists and six steals over 33 minutes . Curry hit five three - pointers for 15 points in the first half alone , but did n't have to do much in the second half considering the Warriors ' extensive lead . Defensively , the six steals marked a career playoff - high for Curry as well . Both Harrison Barnes and Andre Iguodala were also very effective though .

The Grizzlies , on the other hand , were led by Marc Gasol . Gasol recorded 18 points ( 8 - 22 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) , 12 rebounds and six assists , but he did n't receive enough help from the rest of his team . The double - double was his third straight , increasing his series averages to 19 points and 10 rebounds per game . Zach Randolph looked like he was going to have a solid showing after 11 points in the first quarter alone . It turned out to be the exact opposite though , as he hit just one shot the rest of the game and finished with 13 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt ) , to go along with 10 rebounds over 34 minutes . Randolph had put up at least 15 shot attempts in seven of the first eight games of the postseason , but he 's now gone two straight outings with 12 attempts or less . Mike Conley posted 13 points ( 5 - 10 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) and five assists , while Jeff Green recorded 10 points ( 5 - 13 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt ) and four rebounds .

Toronto is on pace for the first 50 - win season in the franchise 's history , and currently the team sits at second in the Eastern Conference . The Raptors faced a tough challenge on Friday against one of the NBA 's hottest teams , but came away with the victory nontheless . The Raptors backcourt combined for 66 points , with DeMar DeRozan leading the team with 38 . DeRozan went a ludicrous 24 for 25 from the free - throw line , seemingly drawing every foul en route to the team 's victory .

The two combined for 74 points on Friday , with 50 coming from point guard Damian Lillard .

At 25 years old , it seems Kawhi Leonard is experience statistical growth in almost every category . With 29 on Friday , Leonard is now averaging 29 points per game through his first six contests . He is also averaging a career - high four assists per game through the first six contests . While both numbers are impressive for the two - time Defensive Player of the Year , it seems that where Leonard is exerting the most statistical dominance is the free - throw line . Kawhi went a perfect 10 - for - 10 from the line on Friday , and has now missed just two of his 55 free - throw attempts on the season . As the season continues , it will be seen if Leonard 's significant growth in most box score columns is sustainable . It was a tale of two teams from the free - throw line on Friday , as the Spurs ( with Leonard 's assistance ) shot over 90 percent from the charity stripe . Utah , meanwhile , did not fare as well , hitting just 65 percent of their attempts at the line .

He has now combined to score just 17 points and shoot 7 - of - 20 from the field over his last two games - - both of which have been losses for the Mavericks . It was the 12th time this season where Dirk has failed to score at least 10 points , and while he is n't the the same player he was in his All-Star prime , it still has had a negative impact on the team , as they are just 4 - 8 in those 12 outings .
The Houston Rockets defeated the Denver Nuggets , 125 - 124 , at Toyota Center on Monday . In a battle between two elite offenses , there were 249 combined points in this barn burner .

A Dirk Nowtizki jumper with 1:39 to play cut the lead to just six points , and a pair of Tyson Chandler free throws less than a minute later brought Dallas within four . After Taj Gibson split a pair from the line on the other end , Monta Ellis responded with a long two - point jumper plus the foul to bring the Mavs within two . Dallas smothered a Derrick Rose drive attempt with less than 10 seconds to play , but Rose was able to deflect the rebound out to the perimeter , and Dallas was forced to foul with 0 second remaining .

Avery Bradley scored 22 points ( 9 - 15 FG ) and added nine rebounds , and Kelly Olynyk scored 22 of his own in just 21 minutes off the bench behind a hugely efficient shooting night ( 7 - 12 FG , 4 - 6 3PT , 4 - 4 FT ) . Boston shot just 7 - 22 ( 32 percent ) from the three - point line but was sharp enough in the rest of their offensive game to overcome the poor outside shooting . Victor Oladipo 's 25 points led the Magic . The point guard shot 10 - 17 from the field and added a team - high eight rebounds and five steals . Evan Fournier , Aaron gordon and Andrew Nicholson were the only other Magic players to top double - digits , as they scored 13 points apiece . Orlando shot just 42 percent from the floor and a brutal 5 - 18 ( 28 percent ) from three - point land , as they never were able to generate the offense to compete in this one . The Magic head to Detroit for a Wednesday matchup against the Pistons . The Celtics continue their homestand Wednesday against the Raptors .
The New York Knicks ( 3 - 8 ) defeated the Denver Nuggets ( 2 - 7 ) 109 - 93 on Sunday . New York was coming off a depressing buzzer - beating loss to the Utah Jazz on Friday in which Trey Burke sank a long two - point field goal as time expired . The Knicks ' win Sunday marks the end of their seven - game losing streak . Carmelo Anthony has been told by coach Derek Fisher to play his game and not overthink everything trying to perfectly execute the Triangle offense . In his last two games , Anthony has averaged 37 points , indicating that he 's possibly starting to find his way within the new system . The Knicks go on the road to Milwaukee on Tuesday to face the Bucks . Denver has been the enigma of the NBA this season . They have a lot of talent , but they ca n't seem to figure out how they want to use it from game to game . As a team , they shot 39 percent from the field and coughed up 17 turnovers to the Knicks on Sunday . The Nuggets suffered through a six - game losing streak already this season , and Sunday 's loss may be the start of another losing streak with the team finishing their current three - game roadtrip in Cleveland on Monday against the Cavaliers .
The Houston Rockets ( 11 - 3 ) defeated the New York Knicks ( 4 - 11 ) 91 - 86 on Monday at the Toyota Center in Houston . With Carmelo Anthony leaving the game in the second quarter due to back spasms , the Knicks were unable to make a comeback after being down 51 - 46 at halftime . They were able to out - shoot the Rockets , as they went 46 percent from the field compared to the 42 percent of Houston , but with James Harden taking control in the final quarter , the Knicks were n't able to find an answer to steal a victory from the Rockets on the road . Harden was an absolute force on Monday . He shot a ridiculous 11 - for - 22 from the field and 7 - for - 12 from the three - point line to finish with a season - high of 36 points , while also adding six rebounds and six assists . In the past three games , Harden has now scored 92 points , as he continues to make his case for this season 's MVP award . Harden did receive a little help though . With Terrence Jones out for at least another three or four weeks , Donatas Motiejunas continued to take his place and scored 13 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt ) , while grabbing eight rebounds . Trevor Ariza was the only other Rocket to reach double figures in points as he finished with 10 . He seemed to struggle with his shot though , as he went only 3 - for - 10 from the field and 2 - for - 6 from the three - point line . Despite having three starters out with injury , the Rockets still secured the victory . The Knicks really struggled to find any offense with Anthony leaving during the second quarter . Despite playing only 18 minutes , Anthony led the team in points with 14 . Jose Calderon led all other starters with nine points and five assists . He shot 3 - for - 7 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from the three - point line in only his second game of the season since returning from injury . The Knicks did receive 49 points from the bench in this matchup , though spread out between many players . Travis Wear led all bench scorers with nine points ( 4 - 7 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) in 17 minutes . Amare Stoudemire , Shane Larkin , J.R. Smith and Pablo Prigioni all had eight points off the bench as well .

The San Antonio Spurs ( 35 - 23 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 20 - 36 ) 107 - 96 on Friday . The Spurs have been struggling as of late , losing their four games previous to Friday 's win over the Kings , who were without DeMarcus Cousins due to hip and ankle injuries . Kawhi Leonard played a team - high 36 minutes and finished with 17 points , seven rebounds , five assists , two blocks and one steal to lead his team to victory . Tiago Splitter had nine rebounds and three blocks . He was given the start at center , which moved Aron Baynes to the bench . Baynes played 18 minutes and scored eight points .

Second-year player Ben McLemore led Sacramento in points with 21 . He hit 10 of his 12 free throw attempts . The Kings are now 13 - 17 at home this season .

The Utah Jazz defeated the host Milwaukee Bucks , 109 - 95 , at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Friday . The Jazz stifled the Bucks just a few weeks ago and they put it to them yet again here .

In fact , Utah won the rebounding battle , 42 - 35 and the points in the paint differential , 52 - 34 . The Jazz ended up shooting 50 percent from the field , while holding the Bucks to 43 percent . The Jazz were up by at least eight points for the final 32 minutes .

Derrick Favors finished second on the team with 19 points , seven rebounds , two assists and two blocks . Rudy Gobert added another double - double to his tally , amassing 15 points , 16 rebounds and four blocks . George Hill finished with 19 points and four steals , going 8 - of - 8 from the free - throw line . The Bucks ( 25 - 31 ) went into the All-Star break with three - straight wins , but this loss was more indicative of their prior form . Giannis Antetokounmpo did all he could for Milwaukee , as he led the team with 33 points , 12 rebounds , three assists and five steals . Michael Beasley was the only other Bucks player in double figures , as he accrued 22 points and six rebounds on 10 - of - 17 shooting .
The Golden State Warriors defeated the Orlando Magic 122 - 92 at Oracle Arena on Thursday . The Warriors ( 53 - 14 ) bounced back with two straight wins following a three game skid with a rout of the Magic ( 24 - 45 ) on Thursday , led by Klay Thompson 's hot hand , where he scored 27 points in the first half . Golden State started off on a 21 - 7 run and carried a 20 - points lead into the second quarter . Orlando had no answer for the 58 percent shooting effort put for by the Warriors , and when Thompson cooled off considerably in the second half , Stephen Curry picked right up and started to rack up some points of his own . Thompson finished with 29 points , five assists and four rebounds on 12 - of - 20 shooting , including five three pointers . Curry went on to finish with 25 points , nine assists , one board and three steals , including a highlight reel nutmeg pass to Zaza Pachulia for an exclamation point during the game . Pachulia completed a double - double to the tune of 10 points and 10 rebounds , while Draymond Green rounded out the box score with nine points , 11 rebounds and six assists across 25 minutes . Orlando toyed with a handful of different rotations with 10 players playing at least 17 minutes in the loss . Elfrid Payton led all Magic scorers with 13 points , while Evan Fournier 's 12 points and Nikola Vucevic 's 10 points were no match for the starters of the Warriors . Jeff Green was the strongest bench player , and added 13 points and four rebounds on 6 - of - 9 shooting across 18 minutes . The Magic shot just 37 percent from the field and 26 percent from behind the arc . Next up , the Magic play the second game of a back - to - back when they visit the Phoenix Suns on Friday , while the Warriors host the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday .
The Boston Celtics hung on to defeat the host Atlanta Hawks , 103 - 101 , at Phillips Arena on Friday evening . After a strong 28 - 18 first quarter , the Celtics let up a bit in the second , allowing the Hawks to pull within four points heading into halftime . The Celtics came out of the locker room firing on all cylinders and pushed the lead back up to 13 heading into the fourth . However , the Hawks were not done yet as they rallied back with a 34 - 23 run in the fourth quarter , capped off by a Paul Millsap jumper to tie the game up at 101 , with 25 seconds to go . The Celtics had the answer though , in the form of a 5 - foot - 9 point guard , as Isaiah Thomas fearlessly knocked down a 19 - foot jumper , with two seconds remaining to give Boston the lead and ultimately seal the win . This marks the fifth win in six games for the Celtics ( 25 - 15 ) , as they hang on tight to their third - place position in the Eastern Conference . Isaiah Thomas has been leading the charge all season and this game was no different , as he poured in 13 of his team - high 28 points in the fourth quarter . Thomas had help though , as Kelly Olynyk poured in a season - high 26 points on 9 - of - 11 shooting , in 32 minutes off the bench . Jae Crowder chipped in 18 points , while the only other Celtics player to score in double digits was Al Horford , who added 10 . Horford had a relatively quiet game in his return to his old stomping ground , but the fact that his new team came away with the win is enough . The Celtics move to 13 - 9 on the road , and will head back home to play host to the Hornets on Monday . Meanwhile , the Hawks ( 22 - 17 ) saw their seven - game win streak come to an end , as the visiting Celtics stole one from them at home . Atlanta had five players score in double digits , including Tim Hardaway Jr. and Paul Millsap , who each finished with a team - high 23 points . Dwight Howard added 11 points and grabbed eight rebounds , while Malcolm Delaney added 17 points on 6 - of - 11 shooting , including 3 - of - 3 from long range , in 27 minutes off the bench . The Hawks move to 10 - 8 at home this season and will look to bounce back , as they play host to the Bucks on Sunday .
The Pistons pulled off the road upset in the season opener against the Hawks on Tuesday night , upending Atlanta by a score of 106 - 94 . The two teams’ performance from the three - point line was the determining factor in this one , as the visiting Pistons knocked down 12 - of - 29 shots ( 41 percent ) from deep . The Hawks , meanwhile were an ugly 8 - for - 27 ( 30 percent ) from beyond the arc . Detroit rode a balanced scoring attack to the victory column , as all five starters finished with at least 15 points . Leading the way was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope , who shook off a recent foot injury to pour in 21 points on 7 - for - 14 shooting , including a 4 - for - 7 mark from three - point range . The Pistons also received strong production on the interior from Andre Drummond , who tallied 18 points and 19 rebounds . The double - doubles should roll in with regularity this season for Drummond , who recorded 48 such efforts in 2014 - 15 . Meanwhile , the Hawks hardly resembled a squad that won a franchise - best 60 games a season ago . In addition to getting very little scoring from their starting backcourt - - the trio of Jeff Teague , Kyle Korver , and Kent Bazemore finished with just 25 points between them - - the Hawks were also bullied on the interior by Drummond & Co. Al Horford pulled down just four rebounds on the evening , and the Pistons held a 59 - 40 edge on the glass over the night . It didn’t help matters that the Hawks lost backup big man Mike Muscala to a right ankle sprain over the course of the game . The Hawks will look to regroup when they visit the Knicks on Friday , while Detroit will have a quick turnaround and play the second game of a back - to - back set at home Thursday against the Jazz .
The Memphis Grizzlies ( 26 - 20 ) defeated the visiting Orlando Magic ( 20 - 23 ) 108 - 102 in overtime at FedEx Forum on Monday . The game had 21 lead changes and was tight throughout regulation , but a Jeff Green hook shot from about 12 feet out forced overtime where Memphis dominated . Green recorded a season - high 30 points with eight rebounds , two steals and an assist in 31 minutes off the bench , as the Grizzlies won for the 10th time in their last 11 at home . Memphis saw Tony Allen return to the lineup after missing two games with a sore knee and hamstring . Allen was in top form as he posted a career - high 12 rebounds with nine points and four steals in 40 minutes . Zach Randolph recorded a double - double with 18 points ( 8 - 16 FG ) and 13 rebounds in a solid bounce - back win for the Grizzlies after their previous loss . The Magic , in the first of a three - game road trip , came out strong , scoring 65 points in the first half against the renowned Memphis defense . Three players scored a team - high 16 points , including Evan Fournier , who also had five assists and three rebounds in 35 minutes off the bench . Nikola Vucevic finished with 16 points and 14 rebounds , as well as three assists and two blocked shots in 39 minutes . Tobias Harris finished with 16 points , four rebounds and three assists in 39 minutes . Orlando made 19 turnovers , leading to their sixth loss in a row .

The Washington Wizards defeated the Brooklyn Nets , 114 - 110 , in overtime at Barclays Center on Wednesday . The Nets ( 9 - 44 ) continue to sport the NBA 's worst record , but that has n't deterred them from playing hard in the majority of recent games . Such was the case again Wednesday , as Brooklyn battled back from a 59 - 49 halftime deficit to knot matters up at 100 with 41 seconds left on a Bojan Bogdanovic six - foot jumper . Bogdanovic , Trevor Booker and John Wall would go on to miss baskets before the clock hit double zeros , sending the game into overtime . The two teams continued to trade the lead for nearly the first four minutes of overtime before a pair of Otto Porter free throws with 1:21 remaining gave the Wizards ( 31 - 21 ) a lead they would n't relinquish . Wall and Bradley Beal would go on to sink a pair of baskets apiece from the charity stripe as well , providing Washington with the breathing room they needed to seal the win . Washington was led by Beal 's 31 points , which he supplemented with six rebounds , two assists and two steals . Wall posted a 23 - point , 12 - assist double - double that also included six rebounds , two blocks and one steal . Porter provided a 20 - point , 10 - rebound double - double that also included an assist and a steal . Marcin Gortat posted 14 points , 14 boards , one assist , one steal and one block .

Sean Kilpatrick managed 10 points , four rebounds and two assists . The Wizards head back home to do battle with the Indiana Pacers on Friday night , while the Nets remain home to face off with the Miami Heat on Friday evening as well .
These are two teams going in opposite directions , as Miami were able to capture their third - straight win . The Heat did most of their damage in the first half , leading , 53 - 43 , headed into the locker room . Shooting was the difference in the game , with the Heat shooting 53 percent , while the Bucks could n't crack 42 percent . Giannis Antetokounmpo led Milwaukee in scoring , as he accumulated 24 points , 10 rebounds , three assists and two steals in the defeat . Jabari Parker came off the bench for disciplinary issues and finished second on the team with 16 points , seven rebounds and four assists . Dion Waiters was the player of the game , as he tied a career - high with 33 points on 12 - of - 19 shooting in the win . Goran Dragic was n't far behind , providing 25 points and six assists . Hassan Whiteside totaled 16 points and 15 rebounds en route to a double - double .
The Bulls ( 14 - 8 ) extended their winning streak to two games , knocking off the Blazers ( 17 - 6 ) in Chicago on Friday . The Bulls withstood a huge first quarter from LaMarcus Aldridge , who scored 21 points on 10 - of - 12 shooting . Chicago was able to keep him under control the rest of the night , however , as Aldridge finished with 35 points and nine rebounds . Damian Lillard added 35 points of his own , and Wes Matthews had 10 points and four rebounds . Nic Batum struggled , scoring seven points on just 3 - of - 12 shooting . The Blazers shot 49 percent from the field and 50 percent from three but were out - rebounded 47 - 37 . Derrick Rose paced Chicago with 31 points ( 14 - 24 FG ) to go with five assists and three rebounds . Taj Gibson , starting in place of the injured Joakim Noah , chipped in 10 points and 12 rebounds , and Pau Gasol had a 13 - point , 10 - rebound double - double .

Chicago heads to Miami to take on the Heat on Sunday evening .
The Los Angeles Clippers ( 32 - 16 ) defeated the Chicago Bulls ( 26 - 20 ) 120 - 93 on Sunday . The score would indicate a lopsided game , but it was close until the second half . The Clippers outscored the Bulls by 23 over the final 24 minutes and much of that has to be attributed to the lights - out shooting . The Clippers went 17 - for - 32 from three - point range and shot 54 percent from the field in the win . The bench production was huge as well , as Los Angeles got 58 bench points to Chicago 's 18 . The Bulls went scoreless for the last five minutes of the game and that was indicative of their recent form . Chicago has now lost eight of their last 12 games and a performance like this doesn’t bode well for the future . Derrick Rose had a nice game though , as he tallied 20 points , five rebounds and four assists in the defeat . Pau Gasol was also efficient , as he amassed 15 points , 14 rebounds and five assists in under 30 minutes of action . The Bulls will have to hop on a plane and play on Monday , as they take on the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City in their next game . The Clippers played one of their best team performances of the season here , as they recorded 26 assists en route to a 27 - point blowout . The star of the show was Jamal Crawford , as he scored 26 points off the bench , while putting the game out of hand in the fourth quarter with 10 - straight points . DeAndre Jordan was fantastic as well , as he accumulated 17 points , 20 rebounds , four assists and four blocks in a dominating performance . Up next is another winnable game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday .
The short - handed Atlanta Hawks ( 47 - 12 ) notched their league - leading 47th win of the season Saturday , defeating the Miami Heat ( 25 - 33 ) 93 - 91 at the American Airlines Arena . When Kent Bazemore buried a three - pointer with just over a minute left in the fourth , the air went out of the American Airlines Arena . The Heat recovered from a 15 - point deficit in the first half to make this game competitive , but the comeback effort fell short . The game got off to a rocky start , with the Hawks leading 17 - 12 at the end of the first quarter . The Hawks rested starters Demarre Carroll , Jeff Teague , and Al Horford for this contest , but the reserves stepped up in their absence . Dennis Schroder and Kent Bazemore had 16 and 15 points respectively as the Hawks staved off a late charge from Miami . Atlanta has gotten back on track with four consecutive victories after being blown out by Toronto in its first game back from the break . Along with Schroder and Bazemore 's big outings , John Jenkins contributed 12 points and seven rebounds . Elton Brand stepped into the starting lineup and added seven points and eight rebounds . The Hawks will return to action Tuesday against the Rockets . Miami lost its second game in as many nights as it fell to Atlanta for the third time this season on Saturday . Hassan Whiteside 's incredible 14 - point , 24 - rebound outing was n't enough to negate Miami 's poor shooting effort . Miami finished the game shooting just 40 percent from the floor and 7 - for - 26 from beyond the arc . The Heat 's loss allows several teams to gain ground on them in the Eastern Conference playoff race . Miami is idle Sunday before hosting Phoenix on Monday .
The Portland Trail Blazers ( 6 - 3 ) defeated the Brooklyn Nets ( 4 - 4 ) 97 - 87 on Saturday . Portland has won four straight games , and they earned their latest win with LaMarcus Aldridge ( illness ) and Nicolas Batum ( knee ) out of the lineup . Allen Crabbe has been filling in as the starting small forward while Batum has been out the last three games , and coach Terry Stotts threw a minor curve ball Saturday by inserting Meyers Leonard into the starting lineup in place of Aldridge . Leonard pulled down 12 rebounds and showed off his new three - point shot , converting 1 - of - 3 attempts . The Trail Blazers have two more games on their homestand , with the next coming against the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday . Brooklyn dropped all three games on their short Western Conference roadtrip , and they 'll head home to host the Miami Heat on Monday . Portland 's three - point shooting was too much for Brooklyn on Saturday , and the Nets struggled on offense , shooting just 39 percent from the field and five percent from beyond the arc . Kevin Garnett recorded a double - double of 12 points and 12 rebounds in 27 minutes .
The New Orleans Pelicans ( 4 - 3 ) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers ( 1 - 7 ) 109 - 102 on Wednesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans .

Despite committing five more turnovers , the Pelicans were stil able to out - rebound the Lakers 44 - 38 , helping to push them to the victory . Like he 's done so many times this season , Anthony Davis took the lead for the Pelicans . He contributed a team - high 25 points ( 12 - 16 FG , 1 - 4 FT ) and 12 rebounds , giving Davis his sixth double - double in seven games . He also had a game - high six blocks as well . Tyreke Evans had a solid offensive showing , going 8 - for - 16 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score 19 points , while also handing out 11 assists . This was Evans ' third double - double on the season . Ryan Anderson also had his second straight game getting hot off the bench as he chipped in 17 points , after scoring 32 on Monday . The Lakers had all five starters reach double figures , while the bench had only 18 points as a whole . Kobe Bryant got off another 28 shots Wednesday , converting on 10 of them . He also went 5 - for - 11 from beyond the arc , finishing with 33 points and five assists . Jordan Hill missed his second straight double - double by two rebounds as he scored 10 points and added eight rebounds . Carlos Boozer was the other high scorer for the Lakers . He had 16 points in 33 minutes . Boozer is now averaging 13 points and 6 rebounds on the year . The Pelicans ' next game will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday , while the Lakers will be at home Friday against the San Antonio Spurs .
The Miami Heat ( 6 - 3 ) defeated the Utah Jazz ( 4 - 4 ) 92 - 91 on Thursday . Both teams played without key pieces , as Dwyane Wade was forced to miss the contest due to a family matter , while Rudy Gobert was unable to shake off the effects of the rolled ankle he suffered versus the Cavaliers on Tuesday . In their absences , Chris Bosh and Derrick Favors elevated their already impressive games and put their respective teams’ offenses on their shoulders . Bosh filled the stat sheet with 25 points , eight rebounds , four assists , and four blocks , including a key stuff at the basket on a driving Alec Burks late in the fourth quarter . Meanwhile , Favors posted a 25 - point,12 - rebound double - double that also included an eye - popping seven blocks , three steals , and a pair of assists . Favors’ gargantuan effort was supplemented by another excellent performance from Alec Burks off the Jazz bench . The fifth - year pro tallied his second consecutive 24 - point performance on a season - high 35 minutes . Gordon Hayward enjoyed a 24 - point night of his own , which marked a season high in scoring for the sixth - year pro . Unfortunately for Utah , starting shooting guard Rodney Hood was the only other player able to score in double figures , and he barely reached the benchmark with only 10 points . The Jazz dropped to 4 - 4 and currently reside in third place in the Western Conference’s Northwest Division , pending the outcome of the ongoing Warriors-Timberwolves contest . They make the trek north for a road tilt versus Orlando on Friday . In addition to Bosh’s standout night , Tyler Johnson rivaled Burks with a strong performance in a reserve role himself , pouring in 17 points and chipping in four rebounds , three assists , two blocks , and a steal . Johnson’s efficient night helped to make up for the loss of Wade , as did Goran Dragic’s strong first - half performance . The Heat point guard was much quieter in the second half , but did make a couple of key free throws late in the game to finish as the only other Miami player with double - digit scoring ( 14 points ) . The Heat improves to 6 - 3 on the season and remains in second place behind the Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference’s Southeast Division . They now benefit from four full days off before facing the Minnesota Timberwolves next Tuesday .
Orlando and Los Angeles played in a tightly contested game consisting of 25 lead changes , and the Magic ended up needing everyone of them . Orlando won the game 101 - 99 after NIkola Vucevic hit a 20 footer as time expired . Vucevic sat out the previous three games with a bone bruise in his right knee . He did n't start the game as the Magic intended on easing him back into action . HIs knee is seemingly doing much better as he ended up playing 26 minutes and putting up 18 points ( 9 - 16 FG ) , five boards , two assists , one block , and one turnover . The Lakers were without Kobe Bryant as they opted to rest him on second half of a double - header . Without him , they spread the ball around , resulting in six players scoring in double figures . Roy Hibert led the way with 15 points , eight rebounds , four assists , and one block in 29 minutes . Los Angeles will look to improve on their 1 - 7 record when they travel to Dallas Friday . Vucevic was n't the only stellar performer coming from Orlando 's bench . Due to Victor Oladipo forced to leave the game in the first quarter after suffering a concussion , Shabazz Napier played a season high 30 minutes . He led the team with 22 points ( 8 - 16 FG , 5 - 9 3PT , and 1 - 1 FT ) . The Magic welcome the Knicks into Orlando on Saturday .
The Houston Rockets defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 109 - 105 on Saturday . The Rockets made an epic 3 - 1 comeback in last seasons playoffs against the Clippers and they showed here that the comenack was no fluke by winnin a big game on the road . The demise of James Harden was well publicized last week and it was downright wrong , as he put together another huge game on Saturday . The Clippers played this game without point guard Chris Paul who was dealing with a groin injury and that clearly hampered them here in the loss . Houston started off the season with three - straight 20 - point losses , but they appear to be out of that swoon at this point with four - straight wins . They have scored 110 points or more in all four wins and that can be attributed to James Hardan taking over the offense . Harden is clearly back to top form , as he has dropped 89 points over the last two nights . This was the second half of a back - to - back and it 's a great sign for Houston to see them play so well in that scenario against a team like the Clippers . They even got to rest Dwight Howard on Friday night and that proved to be crucial for this game , as he tallied 20 points and 20 rebounds in the win . The Rockets will have a few days off and look to keep that winning - streak alive against the winless Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday , The Clippers had to play this game without their point guard Chris Paul and it was just too difficult for them to function fully without their playmaker . Austin Rivers filled in for Paul and put up 10 points and one assist in the loss . The Clippers were led Blake Griffin , who totaled 35 points , 11 rebounds and five assists in the loss . One stat that coach Doc Rivers will love is that all 10 players who played more than a single a minute in this game recorded an assist in the absence of assist - master Chris Paul . The next game on tap for the Clippers is against the struggling Memphis Grizzlies on Monday .
The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Philadelphia 76ers , 111 - 103 , at Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday . The Spurs ( 40 - 12 ) have undoubtedly observed that the Sixers ( 18 - 34 ) seem to be a different team from seasons past , when their presence on a schedule almost guaranteed a win . Philadelphia has been most effective at home , where they 've managed a 12 - 15 record . It was therefore no surprise that it took double - digit scoring from all five San Antonio starters and success rates of over 50 percent from the field and three - point range for the visitors to tough out a win . The Spurs were unable to truly separate from their hosts at any point , as the Sixers battled impressively despite the continued absence of Joel Embiid . San Antonio also was buoyed by the return of Kawhi Leonard , who had missed Monday 's contest against the Grizzlies with a quad injury . Leonard led the way for San Antonio with 32 points , six rebounds and five assists . Tony Parker followed with 18 points , five assists and a rebound . LaMarcus Aldridge posted a 15 - point , 10 - rebound double - double that also included a pair of blocks . Danny Green poured in 11 points and supplemented them with three rebounds and a pair of steals . Dewayne Dedmon supplied a 10 - point , 11 - rebound double - double that also included three assists and a block . Davis Bertans led the bench with nine points , one rebound and one assist .

The Indiana Pacers ( 29 - 34 ) defeated the Orlando Magic ( 21 - 44 ) 118 - 86 on Tuesday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis . In an all - around dominant performance , the Pacers used a strong second half , where they out - scored the Magic 59 - 39 , to finish off the 32 - point victory in front of their home crowd . They shot extremely well in this one , going 53 percent from the field and 50 percent from the three - point line , while the Magic finished at just 37 percent from the floor and a meager 24 percent from deep . With the Pacers hitting 13 more three - pointers than the Magic , they had little to no chance of making a comeback Tuesday . The Pacers got a ridiculous amount of production from their bench , as their bench out - scored the Magics 73 - 18 . That effort was led by Rodney Stuckey , who went 13 - for - 19 from the field and 6 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 34 points , while also adding six rebounds and seven assists . It was a new season - high in points for the guard , who 's now averaging 19 points and 4 assists over his last six games . Joining Stuckey off the bench was Luis Scola , who recorded 15 points ( 6 - 8 FG , 3 - 3 FT ) and 10 rebounds in just 20 minutes . It marked just his fourth double - double of the season and first since the start of February . He 's now averaging 9 points and 6 rebounds on the year . Making just his second career start , Damjan Rudez was forced into the starting lineup , after CJ Miles was a late scratch with a foot injury . He took advantage of the start , hitting nearly everything he shot and finished with 17 points ( 6 - 8 FG , 5 - 7 3Pt ) , to go along with five assists . It marked just his sixth time this season reaching double - digit points . George Hill added 13 points ( 5 - 14 FG , 2 - 8 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) and six assists as well . Doing the best he could to keep the Magic close in this game was Tobias Harris , who went off for 22 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 5 - 6 FT ) , six rebounds and two assists in 30 minutes . He 's picked his game up of late , and is averaging 21 points and 5 rebounds over his last three games . Victor Oladipo struggled offensively in this one , and scored just 13 points ( 4 - 12 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , while adding three steals and three blocked shots . He recorded over 20 points in each of his last four games , so it was a disappointing performance for the guard . Rookie Elfrid Payton was in double figures for his third straight game , as he finished with 14 points ( 5 - 13 FG , 4 - 6 FT ) , to go along with six assists . Over that three - game stretch , he 's averaging 14 points , 6 rebounds and 8 assists , as he 's done a little bit of everything for the Magic during that span . Nikola Vucevic chipped in with 13 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 1 - 2 FT ) and five rebounds as well . The Pacers ' next game will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday , while the Magic will travel to Milwaukee to play the Bucks on Wednesday .
DeMarcus Cousins exploded for a massive 36 - point , 20 - rebound double - double that also included four assists , two steals and a block , but it was n't enough to overcome a similarly impressive 31 - point outing from Bradley Beal that included 12 - of - 24 and 4 - of - 7 tallies from the field and three - point range , respectively . John Wall registered a 19 - point , 11 - assist double - double while also hauling in eight rebounds , but he committed a game - high 11 turnovers . Otto Porter and Marcin Gortat combined for 25 points and 15 rebounds , while Kelly Oubre , Jr. led the bench with a 10 - point , 10 - rebound double - double . Rudy Gay was next behind Cousins with 18 points but the rest of the starting five fell short on the stat sheet , as Darren Collison , Arron Afflalo and Kosta Koufos combining for just 13 points . Ty Lawson led the bench with a 12 - point effort .
The Washington Wizards defeated the Los Angeles Clippers , 117 - 110 , at Verizon Center on Sunday . The contest was a battle of two surging squads , with the Clippers ( 20 - 8 ) having checked in to Sunday on a four - game win streak , and the Wizards ( 12 - 14 ) having prevailed in four of their previous five contests as well . The high - scoring affair was befitting of two teams on the rise , and was tightly - contested through all four quarters . Ultimately , Bradley Beal 's season - high 41 points , which came on the strength of a 13 - of - 23 shooting tally from the field , as well as a 6 - of - 10 mark from three - point range , was too much for the visitors to overcome . Markieff Morris had the hot hand for Washington as well , going 10 - of - 17 from the floor on his way to 23 points . The two stellar offensive efforts led to impressive success rates of 53 percent and 53 percent from the field and three - point range , respectively , for the hosts . The Clippers saw Blake Griffin 's 26 points lead the way , a total he supplemented with seven rebounds , seven assists and a steal . J.J. Redick checked in a rather distant second with 17 points and a rebound . Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan turned in a pair of 13 - point performances that were part of double - doubles .

In Aldridge 's absence , Thomas Robinson and Meyers Leonard had to pick up the slack . They combined for 14 points and nine rebounds off the bench to help out the short - handed frontcourt that is already missing Robin Lopez ( hand ) and Joel Freeland ( shoulder ) .

Despite the lopsided scoreline , this game was close until the final minutes . In fact , the Hawks ended the game on a 23 - 8 run to eventually win by 19 . Shooting was the key difference , as Atlanta surpassed 50 percent from both the field and three - point range , while Orlando barely cracked 40 percent from the field and 30 percent from three - point range . Dennis Schroeder was the player of the game , accumulating 18 points , six rebounds and seven assists . Paul Millsap also had a nice all - around game , collecting 16 points , six rebounds , four assists and four steals .

The Hornets led the whole way in this one , after a very strong , 69 - 53 first half . The Pistons fought back , bringing it to a five - point game late in the third , but could never gain the lead . With this win the Hornets have now won six in a row for the first time in six seasons , and have also won seven in a row at home , where their record is now a solid 24 - 9 . The Pistons came into this one winners of their last two games but had their win streak cut short , and their grip on eighth in the East loosened , as they came in only half a game ahead of Chicago . Kemba Walker was relatively quiet as he failed to record 30 points , a feat which he accomplished in his four previous games . Instead , Walker finished with 16 points ( 3 - 11 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 9 - 9 FT ) , eight assists , one rebound and one steal , in 32 minutes . Six other players scored in double digits for the Hornets , more than compensating for Walker 's quiet game .

Nicolas Batum logged a double - double as he added 17 points and 11 assists , along with five rebounds and two steals , in 37 minutes . The Hornets did a good job at the foul line , hitting 24 - 29 free throws and shot a solid 51 percent from the field and 40 percent from deep . Reggie Jackson had a strong game for Detroit , finishing with 20 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 2 - 9 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , 10 assists and two rebounds , in 31 minutes .

Johnson logged nine minutes , during which he contributed three points ( 1 - 1 3Pt ) . Next , the Pistons head straight to Philly to play the third game of their current four - game road trip , on Saturday . The Hornets will look to extend their overall win streak and also their home win streak as they host the Rockets on Saturday .
While the Pacers have lost two of their last three games , Paul George has been carrying the load for them offensively and on the glass . Tuesday 's loss to New York was yet another example of the swingman putting his offensive and rebounding prowess on display . George finished Tuesday 's game with a team - high 22 points and 10 rebounds , and it was his third straight game with a double - double from points and rebounds . He 's now averaging 23 points and 10 rebounds over those three contests . Across from George on Tuesday , Carmelo Anthony notched a double - double of his own , scoring 22 points and grabbing a game - high 13 rebounds . For Anthony , however , this is a less common occurrence , with Tuesday being his first double - double since late January . Anthony is also on pace this season to have the lowest rebounding averaging of his career since his 2005 - 6 campaign when he averaged just 5 per game .
The Houston Rockets defeated the Chicago Bulls , 115 - 94 , at United Center on Friday evening . The Rockets ( 45 - 21 ) have been one of the NBA 's best squads all season , and a great deal of their success is rightfully attributed to their prolific offense . Typically , it 's the spectacular efforts of James Harden that spearhead the Houston attack , but Friday 's path to victory was a bit of a departure from the norm . It was the returning Ryan Anderson , who 'd missed the team 's tilt against the Jazz on Wednesday with a back injury , that led the way with 21 points , three rebounds and one steal . Additionally , a stellar defensive effort , one that saw Houston limit their hosts to success rates of 39 percent from the field and 23 percent from three - point range , while also forcing them into 18 turnovers , that was pivotal to the win . The Rockets also outscored the Bulls ( 31 - 34 ) by a whopping 69 - 30 margin over the second and third periods , sealing the win before the fourth quarter even began . Harden was second behind Anderson with 19 points , 13 assists , seven rebounds and three steals . He left the game late in the first quarter for a time after getting his foot stepped on but ultimately returned . Clint Capela followed with 17 points , seven boards and one assist . Trevor Ariza turned in an 11 - point , 13 - rebound double - double that also included one assist and two steals . Lou Williams led the bench with 18 points , three rebounds , one assist , two steals and one block . Dwyane Wade paced the Bulls in his return from a two - game absence due to a thigh injury , as he collected 21 points , three rebounds , two assists and two steals . Jimmy Butler totaled 16 points , five rebounds , four assists and one steal . Cameron Payne led the bench with 11 points , two rebounds , two assists and one steal . Bobby Portis produced eight points , six rebounds and one steal , while Paul Zipser , Rajon Rondo and Denzel Valentine all matched Portis ' point total off the bench . The Rockets remain home and await the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday night , while the Bulls make the trek to Beantown for a Sunday afternoon showdown with the Boston Celtics .
The San Antonio Spurs ( 30 - 6 ) continued their great play on Monday , defeating the Milwaukee Bucks ( 14 - 22 ) 123 - 98 . This appeared to be a mismatch on paper and that came to fruition on Monday . The second quarter was when the tides turned , as the Spurs scored 31 points in that 12 - minute stretch while holding the Bucks to just 19 . The benches were a big difference as well , as the Spurs reserves scored 56 points to the Bucks 23 . San Antonio came into this game as a huge favorite and did what they do . While they didn’t play the elite defense they are known for , they blitzed them with efficient offense and ran away with yet another blowout win . Tony Parker sat out this game , but everyone stepped up in his absence . Kawhi Leonard led the team with 23 points and LaMarcus Aldridge put in an impressive double - double . Tim Duncan was coming off his first scoreless performance in his 19 - year career , to post 14 points , 10 rebounds and four assists in a great all - around game . This team just continues to impress and they 'll look to extend their 20 - game winning streak at home on Wednesday against the Utah Jazz in their next fixture . Milwaukee was supposed to have one of the best defenses in the NBA this season , but they continued their poor defense in this game . They allowed at least 29 points in every single quarter and allowed San Antonio to shoot over 55 percent from the field . The bench was especially bad , as no player scored more than five points aside from John Henson who scored just eight . All five starters scored in double - figures , but it simply wasn’t enough against a potent offense like the Spurs . In fact , all five starters tallied at least 11 points , three rebounds and two assists in a great team effort . Milwaukee will have to travel to Chicago for Tuesday’s matchup against the Bulls in a rivalry game .
The Atlanta Hawks ( 59 - 19 ) defeated the Brooklyn Nets ( 35 - 42 ) 114 - 111 on Wednesday in Brooklyn . After a big fourth quarter from the Nets , the two teams went down to the wire , changing leads three times in the last two minutes before an Al Horford dunk and two free throws from Jeff Teague sealed the deal for Atlanta . Horford led the way for the Hawks , posting 24 points ( 11 - 20 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt ) , seven rebounds and four assists in 33 minutes of play . Teague recorded a double - double in the winning effort of 15 points ( 4 - 11 FG , 7 - 11 FT ) , 12 assists , six rebounds and four steals in 33 minutes as well . DeMarre Carroll was the other Atlanta starter to score in double figures , finishing with 19 points ( 7 - 13 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt ) , nine rebounds and four assists in 37 minutes . Mike Scott was also huge for the Hawks off the bench , scoring 20 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) and grabbing eight rebounds in 31 minutes . Paul Millsap was out once again with a shoulder injury , while Mike Muscala got the start in his place , but he had just nine points ( 4 - 6 FG ) in 24 minutes . The win brings Atlanta just one game away from 60 wins on the year with just four games remaining in the regular season . They have already locked up the number one seed for the Eastern Conference playoffs . Brook Lopez , as he has grown a habit of doing , led the way for Brooklyn , scoring 26 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 10 - 10 FT ) and grabbing 10 rebounds in 39 minutes . Over his last two games now , Lopez has put up 58 points and 19 rebounds . Joe Johnson was not too far behind Lopez , scoring 21 points ( 9 - 15 FG , 3 - 9 3Pt ) and grabbing eight rebounds , but he missed the potential game - tying three at the end of regulation . Deron Williams also continues to play well , posting a double - double of 10 points and 13 assists , while Thaddeus Young also recorded a double - double of 15 points and 11 rebounds . Jarrett Jack ( 14 ) and Bojan Bogdanovic ( 12 ) round out the six Nets ' players who scored in double figures . The Nets were hot coming into Wednesday 's matchup as winners of seven of their last eight , and while they are still winners of seven of their last nine , both those losses came at the hands of the Hawks . Regardless , the Nets still find themselves in the playoffs and hold a one - game lead over the Pacers and Heat for the final spot in the East . Up next , the Hawks will head home Friday to take on the Hornets , while the Nets will stay home Friday and play the Wizards .
The Chicago Bulls ( 18 - 12 ) defeated the Indiana Pacers ( 18 - 13 ) 102 - 100 in overtime on Wednesday . The game was a tale of two halves , with Chicago building a 50 - 40 lead by intermission , largely on the strength of a second period in which they outscored the visitors 29 - 19 . However , Indiana came out of the locker room ready to play catch - up in the third period , and clawed all the way back to take a 91 - 89 lead on a Monta Ellis layup with 31 seconds remaining in regulation . Jimmy Butler then made a clutch driving layup for the Bulls at the 25 - second mark to knot things up at 91 . Following Ellis ' missed 30 - foot three - point attempt with one second remaining , the contest went into the extra period . `` Jimmy Buckets '' was the hero again for the home team in the `` fifth quarter '' by notching four points , including a game - winning tip - in with 1 seconds remaining to seal the hard - fought victory . The Pacers ' attack was spearheaded by George Hill , who tallied 20 points , seven rebounds , three assists and four steals . Paul George continued his recent string of sluggish performances , collecting 19 points on 7 of 20 shooting , including 3 of 9 from three - point range . It was notably the fifth time in the last six games that George shot under 40 percent from the field , and the tenth time overall in December . Ellis was able to pitch in 13 points and add five assists , a rebound and a pair of steals , while Lavoy Allen posted a double - double in a rare start , collecting 10 points and hauling in 12 boards . Rodney Stuckey led the Indiana reserves with a 13 - point outing . The Pacers fell to 18 - 13 and into third place behind the Bulls in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They head home for a New Year 's Eve showdown with the Milwaukee Bucks . Butler finished with an outstanding 28 points , and added four rebounds , four assists , two steals and a block . He notably visited the free - throw line 13 times , draining 11 of those attempts successfully . Pau Gasol had a relatively subdued but efficient double - double with 13 points and 11 rebounds . He also added three blocks and a sole assist , which came on Butler 's game - winning shot . While no other starter was able to get into double - digits scoring - wise , two very productive performances off the bench were crucial to Chicago 's cause . With Derrick Rose sitting with a sore hamstring , Aaron Brooks showed he had the hot hand early despite yielding the start to Kirk Hinrich , and ended up playing a robust 41 minutes . Brooks tallied a season - high 29 points , and was successful on four of his seven three - point tries . While he did turn the ball over six times , he provided some badly - needed scoring punch in Rose 's stead . 2015 first - round pick Bobby Portis also pitched in significantly off the bench with 16 points , seven rebounds , a steal and a block . The Bulls improved to 18 - 12 and are now in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division.They remain home for a New Year 's Day matchup against the Knicks .
The Miami Heat ( 17 - 21 ) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers ( 12 - 27 ) 78 - 75 on Tuesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles . Down six with just over 30 seconds left in the game , Kobe Bryant knocked down a contested three - pointer to pull within three . After Wesley Johnson blocked Luol Deng on the other side , Bryant had a shot at another three - pointer to tie the game , but missed it as time expired , giving the Lakers their second loss in as many games . The Heat were the superior shooters in this game , going 42 percent from the field , while the Lakers went just 32 percent from the floor . Dwyane Wade started this game , but had to leave after only 14 minutes as he suffered a mild left hamstring strain . He still finished with four points , five rebounds and five assists . With Wade out of the game , Mario Chalmers took over , scoring 19 points ( 7 - 16 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt , 5 - 7 ) , while adding eight assists and two steals . It was the first time he 's reached double figures in points since mid - December , so it was good to see him show an improved offensive game Tuesday . Chris Bosh did n't have his best game , as he struggled with his shot and scored only eight points ( 4 - 17 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt ) . It was the first time in 21 games that he did n't reach double - digit points . Hassan Whiteside continued to impress , scoring 15 points ( 7 - 9 FG ) and grabbing nine rebounds in 21 minutes . Over his last two games he 's averaged 19 points and 13 rebounds , despite averaging only 7 points and 6 rebounds on the year . The Lakers did n't really have anyone standout in the loss . Kobe Bryant had a rough night , shooting only 3 - for - 19 from the field and 2 - for - 9 from the three - point line to finish with 12 points . He did have six rebounds and seven assists though , so that at least helped offset his poor shooting performance . Jordan Hill had 12 points ( 5 - 12 FG , 2 - 4 FT ) of his own , while adding six rebounds as well . He was right on par with his season averages of 12 points and 8 rebounds . The only other Laker to reach double figures in points was Ed Davis , who went 6 - for - 7 from the field to score 12 points in 23 minutes . He also had eight rebounds . After recording only three points on Sunday , it was a nice bounce back game for him . The Heat 's next game will be on the road against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday , while the Lakers will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday .
The Charlotte Hornets ( 18 - 20 ) snapped a seven - game losing streak with a decisive 107 - 84 win over the Atlanta Hawks ( 23 - 16 ) on Wednesday . Charlotte was finally able to turn its luck around on Wednesday , as the team maintained a firm lead over Atlanta for the final three quarters . Point guard Kemba Walker led the team with 23 points , and also provided a strong defensive performance as he stole the ball three times . Backup Jeremy Lim provided a valuable spark off the bench for Charlotte , as he poured in 19 points and went 8 - for - 8 from the free - throw line . With center Al Jefferson ( meniscus ) still out , Cody Zeller was able to shine in his starting role , posting a 19 - point , 10 - rebound double - double along with three blocks . The Hornets simply dominated every aspect of the game , out - rebounding Atlanta 54 - 37 and shooting 7 percent better from the field . The Hawks , who came into the game well - rested and holding onto first place in the Southeast Division , simply could not make anything happen in Charlotte . All-Star forward Paul Millsap was the only Hawk to score in double - digits , as he led the team with 20 points . Overall , Atlanta struggled from the field , shooting just 37 percent on the night . In what was an unusual issue for Atlanta , a team known for its ball movement , the Hornets held a 26 - 17 advantage in team assists . Atlanta will look to get the ball moving better in a Friday night matchup against Milwaukee . Charlotte , meanwhile , will hope that its luck has changed for good , as it prepares to take on New Orleans on Friday .
The Los Angeles Lakers ( 5 - 13 ) defeated the Detroit Pistons ( 3 - 15 ) 106 - 96 on Tuesday . Los Angeles has won their last two games , defeating the Toronto Raptors 129 - 122 in overtime Sunday before going on the road to beat the Pistons . Kobe Bryant had a dubious triple - double to encore the 31 - point , 11 - rebound and 12 - assist line he put up Sunday . Bryant finished with 12 points , 13 assists and 10 turnovers Tuesday . His barrage of assists have been accompanied by wins for the Lakers , but Bryant has put on passing clinics in small stretches before that faded quickly in the past , indicating that he will likely regress back to being more of a scoring threat than a facilitator most nights . The Lakers have two more games on their road trip , and they 'll finish a back - to - back set Wednesday when they go to Washington to take on the Wizards . Detroit has dropped nine straight games . Over their last two contests , they 've used Greg Monroe off the bench and shifted Josh Smith to power forward so they could add an extra shooter on the wing . Kyle Singler has started at small forward both gmes , but after he played just 17 minutes Tuesday , it appears his hold on the job may not be too tight . While defense is n't the Lakers ' forte , they were successful in limiting the Pistons to 37 percent shooting from the field and 29 percent from beyond the arc . Detroit is playing a back - to - back set , and they 'll travel to Boston to take on the Celtics on Wednesday .
The Utah Jazz ( 24 - 35 ) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies ( 42 - 17 ) 93 - 82 on Tuesday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in Memphis . In a surprise performance , the Jazz were able to take down one of the best teams in their conference , while notching their third straight victory as well . They were the superior shooters in this one , going 45 percent from the field , while the Grizzlies finished at 40 percent . The Jazz also secured a hefty advantage on the boards , as they out - rebounded the Grizzlies 55 - 37 , which may have made the biggest difference in their 11 - point win on the road in Memphis . As they 've done all season long , Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors did the bulk of the work offensively . Hayward went 9 - for - 19 from the field , but missed all six of his three - point attempts , to finish with 21 points , while adding eight rebounds and six assists as well . He 's been absolutely awful from deep over his last five games , going a combined 2 - for - 20 from the three - point line during that stretch , but he was able to overcome the poor shooting and still finish above his season scoring average of 20 points per game . Favors , on the other hand , posted 21 points ( 8 - 14 FG , 5 - 6 FT ) of his own , to go along with six rebounds , two steals and three blocked shots . He 's stepped it up offensively of late , averaging 19 points and 9 rebounds over his last four games . He 's also posted three blocks in each of his last three games . Notching one of his more impressive lines of his season , Rudy Gobert recorded 15 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 3 - 4 FT ) and 24 reobunds in 36 minutes . He looks to be getting more and more comfortable as a member of the starting lineup , posting a double - double in three of his last four games . The rebounds were a season - high .

He 's had a nice stretch of two games , combining for 44 points and 19 rebounds over that span .

Tyson Chandler was unable to take the floor with his back injury , but D'Angelo Russell shook off the effects of a bruised shin to suit up for the Lakers .

He also added a steal and a block . Meanwhile , Russell was able to play 31 minutes , but struggled with his shot .

The Oklahoma City Thunder ( 16 - 9 ) held off the Utah Jazz ( 10 - 12 ) 104 - 98 in an overtime thriller on Sunday . This was a a very close game throughout , until the overtime . Oklahoma City scored eight unanswered points and held the Jazz to just two points in the extra five minutes . The worst part about that is that the one basket for Utah came with less than 10 seconds left , as the Thunder allowed a meaningless uncontested layup . Kevin Durant was the hero , as he tallied 29 points after the halftime buzzer . The free - throw shooting was a huge disparity as well , as the Thunder shot 90 percent on 30 attempts , while the Jazz shot 60 percent on 12 attempts . Utah has played this Oklahoma City team tough twice in a row now , but just couldn’t come away with a win in either game . They lost both games close despite hanging around and just could n't hit any late baskets to pull off a big win . The offense and late game execution is really hurting this team right now and even with their stifling defense , they simply do n't score enough to win against teams as good as this . Three players scored at least 20 points tonight , as Gordon Hayward , Rodney Hood and Alec Burks all played well . It doesn’t get much easier , as the Jazz will travel to San Antonio to take on a Spurs team that is undefeated at home this season . The Thunder have now won nine of their last 11 games and their two superstars are playing brilliantly right now . Durant was white - hot here , catching fire in the second half for 29 points . He finished the game with 31 points , five rebounds and six assists in the win . Russell Westbrook was great as well , as he accumulated 25 points , 11 rebounds and five assists . Serge Ibaka had just seven points and seven rebounds , but recorded six blocks and made some huge stuffs at the end to seal the win . When all three of these guys are playing their roles to perfection , it 's hard to see anyone keeping up with them . Oklahoma City will look to keep this hot stretch going against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday .
The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Washington Wizards , 98 - 93 , at Spectrum Center on Saturday night . The Wizards ( 42 - 27 ) checked into Saturday having played very well over their past two weeks , but also burning the proverbial candle at both ends . Washington had already played 13 games since the All-Star break , and had n't enjoyed two consecutive days off since just before the extended layoff . That pace was bound to catch up with them at some point , and it may have well been Saturday night . The Wizards appeared a bit sluggish on offense , with their final scoring tally representing their lowest since Feb. 26 . They shot just 37 percent from the field and 33 percent from three - point range while also turning the ball over 12 times . The Hornets ( 30 - 39 ) were able to capitalize on their visitors ' fatigue in the second half , when they outscored the Wizards by a 59 - 53 margin to pull off the home victory . John Wall led Washington with a modest 19 points , which he supplemented with eight assists , three rebounds , two blocks and one steal . Bradley Beal was next with 18 points , three boards , two assists , one steal and one block . Otto Porter , Jr. followed with 16 points , three rebounds , one assist and three steals .

The Los Angeles Clippers ( 36 - 19 ) defeated the San Antonio Spurs ( 34 - 20 ) 119 - 115 at the Staples Center . With Blake Griffin sidelined and DeAndre Jordan struggling at the free throw line , Jamal Crawford was the hero for the Clippers on Thursday . Crawford finished with 26 points and five assists in 30 minutes off the bench . It was a back - and - fourth affair throughout , especially in the fourth quarter . The Spurs used the hack - a - Jordan approach on DeAndre Jordan to the tune of Jordan attempting 28 free throws , making only 10 of them . San Antonio is comfortably in playoff position , but missed an opportunity to steal a win on the road to gain ground in the West . Tim Duncan turned in a big performance with 30 points and 11 rebounds and Tony Parker looked good with 21 points and 13 assists . The Spurs have another big test Friday on their nine - game road swing as they will travel to Oakland to take on the Warriors . Los Angeles has now won three straight without Blake Griffin after holding off San Antonio on Thursday . DeAndre Jordan narrowly missed out on another 20 - 20 game as he finished with 26 points and 18 boards . Chris Paul had a big game as well with 22 points and 16 assists over 40 minutes . The Clippers will look to continue their winning streak on Saturday against the Kings .
With Tony Parker battling a foot injury , the Spurs decided to look at rookie Dejounte Murray to take over the starting point guard duties in order to leave Patty Mills in his role off the bench . And in his last four starts in Parker 's absence , Murray has already been impressive . Following his performance of 11 points , three rebounds and two assists in Tuesday 's victory over the Raptors , Murray is now averaging 13 points , 3 assists and 3 rebounds per game over his last four starts , which included a career - high 24 points in last Thursday 's victory over the Nuggets . That is more points and rebounds than Parker 's averages this season , and while it is a small sample size , Murray 's production at just 20 years old not only gives the Spurs insurance for this year 's championship run , but for every one in the future as well .
The Boston Celtics defeated the Dallas Mavericks , 90 - 83 , at TD Garden on Wednesday . The Mavericks ( 2 - 8 ) checked into Wednesday scoring the third - least points per game in the league ( 95 ) , and that trend would rear its ugly head yet again against a Boston squad that was ranked in the bottom 10 in points allowed . Playing once again without Dirk Nowitzki ( Achilles ) , Dallas got precious little production from anyone not named Harrison Barnes or Wesley Matthews . The two players combined for just over 60 percent of the team 's point total , and the Mavs managed just a 42 percent success rate from the field overall . Meanwhile , although the Celtics ( 6 - 5 ) did n't have much more offensive balance on their end , they benefited greatly from a game - high 30 points from Isaiah Thomas , with 22 of those coming in the fourth quarter . Barnes led Dallas with 28 points , but could n't contribute much else in the non - scoring categories , posting two rebounds , an assist and two steals . Matthews drained six - of - 13 three - point attempts on his way to 22 points , and he added three rebounds and two steals . Deron Williams notably was scoreless over 10 minutes in his return from a multi - game absence due to a calf injury , while J.J. Barea paced the reserves with nine points , six assists , two rebounds and a steal over 28 minutes in his stead .

The Mavericks head back home to face the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday , while the Celtics have their own Friday showdown at home against the Golden State Warriors .
The Dallas Mavericks defeated the host Los Angeles Lakers , 101 - 89 , at Staples Center on Thursday . In a battle between a young team and a veteran bunch , the elders were able to escape with a much needed victory . It was the third quarter in which the Mavericks took control , as they outscored the Lakers , 31 - 13 , after trailing by double - digits in the first half . Strangely enough , there was only one tie and two lead changes , as that one momentum swing was extremely decisive . The Dallas offense was on point , as they shot 49 percent from the field , 79 percent from the free - throw line and 45 percent from three - point range . They also dominated the rebounding and assists , as they won the rebounding differential , 42 - 34 and the assist battle , 24 - 15 .

With only John Salmons ( personal reasons ) sitting out , the Pelicans came into the game with a healthy lineup .

Mike Miller has missed the last three games with a concussion . Tuesday was the earliest he could have returned , but he was n't ready . Toronto has dropped two of their last three games , both losses coming against the Cavaliers . DeMar DeRozan 's absence with an adductor injury is having a noticeable impact on the Raptors . They used Greivis Vasquez as the fill - in starter at shooting guard for the first five games DeRozan was out , but they opted to move Vasquez back to the bench and insert Landry Fields into the starting lineup Tuesday to try and put a bigger player on the wing to guard James . The Raptors took the game down to the wire , with Jonas Valanciunas ( 18 points , 15 rebounds ) and Kyle Lowry ( 16 points , 14 assists ) both putting up double - doubles , but their quality performances were n't enough to put the Raptors over the top .
The Memphis Grizzlies ( 41 - 30 ) defeated the Phoenix Suns ( 19 - 51 ) 103 - 97 at Talking Stick Arena on Monday . The Grizzlies are banged up , but they are still finding ways to pull out tough victories and hold on to the 5 - seed in the Western Conference . The Suns would normally be an easy matchup for the physical Memphis style of play , but it took the backcourt some time to get warm before eventually closing out the game late in the fourth quarter . Phoenix was ahead for most of the first half , and extended a lead into double figures midway through the second quarter , however , they were unable to hold onto their lead with the game tied with under one minute remaining in regulation . Lance Stephenson put back a missed layup to take a two point lead , and the Grizzlies did the rest of their damage from the free throw line to close out . The Grizzlies recently signed Jordan Farmar to a 10 day contract , and the signing looked to be a positive one after Farmar saw 22 minutes off the bench and added 12 points on 4 - of - 8 shooting , including two clutch free throws down the stretch . Ray McCallum continues to see starting minutes , and although his shot selection was iffy ( nine points on 3 - of - 10 shooting ) , he did complete seven assists and add two steals . Zach Randolph has become the go - to scorer for Memphis , and continued to be a monster on the glass , as he finished with 14 points and 13 rebounds . The aforementioned Stephenson led all Grizzlies scorers with 16 points . The Suns are amongst the bottom four teams in the league and will towards a lottery pick in the draft , but they played a spirited game , one which they were in control to win up until the final two minutes of play . Devin Booker and Brandon Knight continued their volume shooting , but they were far from efficient , as they combined for 31 points on 9 - of - 30 shooting . Turnovers proved to be the difference maker in the fourth quarter , where the Suns added two miscues in crunch time . Phoenix suffered another setback after Tyson Chandler ( back ) left Monday’s game with back spasms after logging two points and one rebound in 13 minutes of action . Both teams face the Los Angeles Lakers ( 14 - 55 ) next , as the Grizzlies visit Staples Center on Tuesday , while the Suns host Kobe Bryant and company on Wednesday .
The Golden State Warriors ( 50 - 5 ) earned an interconference road win Monday night over the Atlanta Hawks ( 31 - 27 ) at Phillips Arena , 102 - 92 . Even though their shooting was n't as crisp as usual - - 44 percent from the floor , 31 percent from three - point land - - Golden State still ran efficient offense , as they assisted on 30 of their 39 made field goals ( 77 percent ) and turned the ball over just 13 times . The Warriors made 14 of 45 three - pointers ( 31 percent ) and attempted fewer two - pointers ( 44 ) than threes .

Klay Thompson added 27 points ( 10 - 23 FG , 5 - 14 3PT ) as the Warriors ' starting backcourt outscored the Hawks starting guards 53 - 18 . Harrison Barnes was the only other Warrior to reach double figures , as he scored 14 on 5 - 8 shooting . Al Horford was a beast inside in the losing effort , as the Hawks center notched 23 points ( 10 - 20 FG ) , 16 rebounds , six assists and five blocks . Dennis Schroder came off the bench to score 18 points ( 8 - 12 FG ) in just 18 minutes , and Jeff Teague scored 16 points and added six assists .

The Warriors continue their road trip Wednesday against the Heat . The Hawks welcome the Bulls for a Friday contest .
Atlanta is not accustomed to being held to 68 points on 31 percent shooting , but they have n't seen a defense like the one Utah possesses . The Jazz actually ranked first in the NBA with under 95 points a game allowed and that number surely dropped here . Dennis Schroeder was the only starter to play well for the Hawks , as he scored 16 points on an inefficient 6 - of - 19 shooting . Gordon Hayward was the player of the game for Utah , as he dropped 24 points and seven rebounds . George Hill was n't far behind , finishing with 23 points and five rebounds .

Felton also had the game - ending defensive stop on Nuggets big man Kennth Faried . There was very little defense and a whole lot of offense in a game where Dallas had nothing to play for but pride , given that they are locked in as the No . 7 seed in the Western Conference . Given that and the length of the game , most of the starters for the Mavericks were rested for both overtime periods . Despite this , Dirk Nowitzki was still able to score 25 points ( 10 - 19 FG ) and grab nine rebounds in 28 minutes , while Richard Jefferson was close behind , scoring 24 points ( 8 - 15 FG , 4 - 8 3Pt ) in 31 minutes .

Danilo Gallinari was absolutely on fire in the losing effort for the Nuggets , scoring 47 points on a scorching 15 - of - 23 shooting from the field , 7 - of - 12 from three and 10 - 10 from the free throw line in 46 minutes . Gallinari 's 47 points is the most scored by a Denver player since Carmelo Anthony dropped 50 in 2011 . Ty Lawson also had a monster game , scoring 19 points ( 8 - 21 FG ) and dishing out 18 assists in a game - high 52 minutes .

This season , it 's been Irving who 's taken the reins of the offense over the first four games for Cleveland ( 40 ) , and this was once again on display in what turned out to be a shootout against the James Harden and the Rockets ( 2 - 2 ) . The All-Star point guard went for a team - high 32 points and added four assists and two rebounds . As has been the case in each contest , Irving was highly efficient with his shots , draining 10 of 19 attempts from the field overall and finding the net on four of his six three - point tries . Factoring in Tuesday 's production , the sixth - year pro has a stellar 54 percent ( 15 - for - 28 ) success rate from behind the arc over the first four games . His red - hot shooting helped the Cavs shoot 52 and 50 percent from the field and three - point range , respectively .

Hibbert went 6 - for - 11 from the field and a perfect 6 - for - 6 from the free throw line to score 18 points , while also adding seven rebounds .

However , Enes Kanter was the only other player to tally double - digit scoring , posting a 17 - point , 14 - rebound double - double . Among the starters , Serge Ibaka had one of the most forgettable games of his career , going scoreless over 20 minutes before fouling out .

Westbrook 's night was n't the most efficient , however , as he shot just 12 - of - 35 from the field and 1 - of - 6 from behind the arc . Victor Oladipo , on the other hand , had a very efficient evening , shooting 10 - of - 16 from the field en route to 25 points on top of six rebounds and six assists . The Wizards ( 6 - 11 ) are now losers of two of their last three games as they continue to battle inconsistent play early in this season . Bradley Beal , however , has remained consistently deadly since returning from a hamstring injury that sidelined him for three games . His 31 points on Wednesday night was his second straight 30 - point effort in a row and he is now averaging 29 points over his last three games . His partner in the backcourt John Wall struggled shooting from the field , going just 6 - of - 20 overall and 2 - of - 7 from behind the arc , but he did record 15 points and 15 assists - - his second double - double in a row and fourth in the last five games . Washington will look back on this game , however , and see many missed opportunities at the free throw line , where they made just 16 of their 25 attempts . Up next , the Thunder will look to extend their winning streak on Sunday against the Pelicans , while the Wizards will head to San Antonio on Friday to take on the Spurs .
The San Antonio Spurs ( 13 - 3 ) left no loose - ends as they defeated the Denver Nuggets ( 6 - 10 ) by a score of 91 - 80 , on Friday night in Denver . The Spurs held the Nuggets to only 40 percent shooting from the field and commanded control of the game with their defense . They led for the whole second half . Denver had 10 players score but only three of those players scored in double digits . Danilo Gallinari led the Nuggets in scoring with 16 points and made it a double double with 10 rebounds . Will Barton chipped in 12 points and nine rebounds in 29 minutes off the bench . Jameer Nelson also added 12 points off the bench . Denver was missing Kenneth Faried who sat out with an ankle sprain . San Antonio managed to take care of business even with out two of their veteran leaders , Manu Ginobili and Tim Duncan . Kawhi Leonard did what he is trained to do and stepped up for the Spurs in the absence of his veteran mates , finishing with 25 points on 11 - 18 shooting , seven rebounds and six assists . Tony Parker scored 13 points and dished five assists in 24 minutes . Rookie Jonathon Simmons chipped in 12 points on 4 - 8 shooting in 26 minutes off the bench .

Salah Mejri 's performance in Wednesday 's victory over the 76ers was more than just a completely surprise , it was completely out of character . With his 16 - point , 17 - rebound performance , Mejri scored the second highest point total of his career , with 17 being the highest , and recorded a career - high 17 rebounds in just 21 minutes . In the season and a half he 's played in the NBA , Mejri had recorded just two career double - doubles before Wednesday night , and they both came against the Trail Blazers within three days of each other . This season alone , Mejri only had two games where he recorded double - digit rebounds and Wednesday was his first double - digit scoring outing of the 2016 - 17 season . With Bogut steal dealing with a lingering hamstring injury , Mejri 's performance against Philadelphia may have given the Mavericks some much - needed insurance in their frontcourt rotation .
The Phoenix Suns ( 27 - 20 ) defeated the Washington Wizards ( 31 - 16 ) 106 - 98 on Wednesday at the US Airways Center in Phoenix . Coming out of the third quarter , the Suns had a nice 80 - 66 lead . The Wizards made a run in the fourth though , out - scoring the Suns 32 - 26 , but the comeback fell short as Phoenix finished with an eight - point victory . While the Suns were out - rebounded 50 - 41 , they shot better than the Wizards , going 46 percent from the field , while the Wizards went 42 percent from the floor . Goran Dragic was the leader for the Suns in this game , posting a game - high of 20 points ( 8 - 15 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 2 - 4 FT ) , to go along with two assists and two steals . He had a poor shooting performance ( 3 - 11 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt ) in Sunday 's game against the Clippers , so it was good to see him find his shot and have some success . The Suns also had a nice contribution from their bench , as Isaiah Thomas had 18 points ( 4 - 13 FG , 4 - 8 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) and four assists in only 20 minutes .

Leading the Wizards in points was center Marcin Gortat , who went 6 - for - 12 from the field to score 14 points , while also adding eight rebounds . It 's a very rare occurence for Gortat to lead this team in scoring , so it was clear John Wall and Bradley Beal did n't have their best games offensively . Wall recorded 11 points ( 5 - 16 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt ) , seven rebounds and seven assists , while Beal had 13 points ( 5 - 15 FG , 3 - 3 3Pt ) and one rebound . Wall had just put in three solid games in a row , so it was a surprise to see his shot not falling . Getting the start at power forward , Kris Humphries recorded a double - double with 11 points ( 4 - 8 FG , 3 - 4 FT ) and 15 rebounds . It was his second double - double in his last three games . Otto Porter was the high scorer off the bench with 14 points ( 5 - 8 FG , 3 - 4 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) in 23 minutes . The Suns ' next game will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Friday , while the Wizards will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Saturday .

He came off the bench and scored 17 points to go along with nine rebounds in 29 minutes of ferocious energy . He 's averaged 15 points , 7 rebounds and 1 steals over his past five games .

Thompson was the high scorer for the Warriors , as he poured in 34 points in just 32 minutes of play time . Curry , meanwhile , scored 23 and dished out six assists . Little offensive production was needed outside of the two All-Stars , though the rest of the team still managed to impress on that end . As a whole , the Dubs shot over 48 percent from the field and recorded a stellar 28 team assists . OKC ( 40 - 30 ) came into the game relatively hot but were stopped cold by the powerhouse Warriors . It was an off night for superstar point guard Russell Westbrook , though for a monster like Westbrook , that term is obviously relative . Westbrook still managed to fill the stat sheet with 15 points , eight rebounds , and seven assists . However , he shot a dismal 4 - of - 16 from the field and turned the ball over five times . As a team , it was a remarkably poor offensive night for the Thunder . They made just over 42 percent of their shots and could not hit the deep ball , going just 4 - of - 21 from beyond the arc . The Warriors will visit Dallas on Tuesday , while OKC will host the 76ers on Wednesday .

Westbrook finished with 31 points , 15 assists and 11 rebounds on 13 - of - 34 shooting in 40 minutes of action .

Teague scored 30 points , to go along with nine assists and five rebounds on 9 - of - 16 shooting , including a perfect 9 - of - 9 from the charity stripe . Westbrook 's needed the overtime to complete the triple - double , but was also the reason that Oklahoma City was able to reach the extended period after burying a three pointer from 27 - feet with only a few seconds left in the fourth quarter .
The host Golden State Warriors demolished the Sacramento Kings on Friday , 114 - 100 . Golden State ( 58 - 14 ) is on the verge of its third straight 60 - win season , holding the league 's top record with just 10 games remaining . Fans got to enjoy pure star power on Friday , as the Warriors breezed by the Kings on the backs of two of their healthy All-Stars . Reigning MVP Steph Curry was the team leader in scoring , pouring in 27 points , and also contributed six steals on the defensive end . All-Defense forward Draymond Green , meanwhile , had three steals and a block while scoring 23 points .

The night was just one of many great ones for the historic Warriors offense , as the team shot almost 50 percent from the field while dishing out a ridiculous 37 assists . Sacramento ( 27 - 45 ) is far from the top , as the team dropped its fourth straight game on Friday in miserable fashion . The team showed promise , however , as recently - acquired rookie Buddy Hield had arguably his best game as a pro . Hield scored a team - high 22 points to go along with eight rebounds and seven assists . It was also a big night for the Kings ' other rookie sensation , Skal Labissiere . Just a week after becoming the first member of the 2016 draft class to score 30 points , Labissiere narrowly missed his first career triple - double , coming away with 10 points , 10 rebounds , and eight assists .

The Bucks went without a field goal for a 6:58 stretch in the period as their offense just could n't get revved up . Utah never trailed in the game 's final period as they coasted to the victory . Gordon Hayward scored 18 points and hit three three - pointers to lead the Jazz . The Jazz also got double - doubles from Rudy Gobert with points 12 ( 4 - 7 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) and 14 rebounds ( six offensive ) and Shelvin Mack with 13 points ( 5 - 11 FG ) and 12 assists .

The Bucks actually shot a solid 34 - 65 ( 52 percent ) from the floor , but they managed just two offensive rebounds and hit only three three - point shots , and even their relatively efficient performance inside was n't enough to keep up with the Jazz 's three - point barrage . The Jazz continue their road trip Wednesday in Houston . The Bucks head to Detroit for a Monday matchup against the Pistons .
Monday night 's affair was all about the point guards , with the Thunder 's Russell Westbrook and the Hawks ' Dennis Schroeder performing at their best .

For Schroder , it was just his second performance this season with at least 30 points , but after shooting 63 percent from the field Monday , the point guard has now shot over 50 percent in seven of his nine games in December after shooting a poor 42 percent from the field throughout November .
The Los Angeles Clippers ( 39 - 21 ) defeated the Chicago Bulls ( 37 - 23 ) 96 - 86 on Sunday .

Brooks finished with 14 points on 5 - of - 17 shooting from the field . With Gibson unavailable , Nikola Mirotic put up a game - high 29 points in 31 minutes off the bench .

The Dallas Mavericks ( 15 - 5 ) went on the road and knocked off the Milwaukee Bucks ( 10 - 10 ) 107 - 105 on Wednesday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center .

Barea . Barea chimed in with 18 points , five assists and three rebounds , and included a strong 75 percent shooting from behind the arc . The rest of the Mavericks bench attack was led by Justin Anderson and Dwight Powell , who combined for 15 points and five boards .

The Indiana Pacers defeated the Los Angeles Clippers , 91 - 70 , at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Sunday , The Clippers have been playing some dominant basketball this season , but this was a dud against a desperate Pacers team . Indiana stifled them with their defense , holding them to 70 points on 31 percent from the field and 17 percent from three - point range . The assist - to - turnover ratio was a huge factor as well , with Indiana recording 26 assists to just 14 turnovers and Los Angeles committing 20 turnovers to just 11 assists . Those numbers allowed the Pacers to take 22 more shots than the Clippers , making nearly twice as many shots . Los Angeles ( 14 - 4 ) has been one of the best teams early on in the season , but they really struggled here . Blake Griffin led the team in scoring , tallying 16 points and nine rebounds on 6 - of - 15 shooting . Chris Paul also struggled with his shot , totaling 13 points , four rebounds and four assists on 4 - of - 11 from the field .

Jeff Teague scored just seven points , but dished out 10 assists , Al Jefferson and Rodney Stuckey were nice sparks off the bench , accumulating 28 points and 13 rebounds between the two . Indiana will look to get above .500 in their next matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday .
The Atlanta Hawks ( 1 - 1 ) defeated the Washington Wizards ( 1 - 1 ) 106 - 90 on Tuesday at Philips Arena in Atlanta . After suffering a tough 104 - 98 defeat to the Wizards in game number one , the Hawks started this outing with some added fire and out - scored the Wizards 28 - 20 right away in the first quarter . Throughout the rest of the game , the Wizards slowly made their way back though , closing the gap to just five points with around four minutes left in the game . The Hawks made one final push and responded with a strong offensive run of their own , eventually finishing with an impressive 16 - point victory in front of their home crowd . With the victory , the Hawks tied the series at one win apiece and they 'll have the momentum going into game three in Washington . The Wizards shot 43 percent from the field and 55 percent from the three - point line , but with John Wall sitting out due to a wrist injury , they were missing their most important weapon . While it was n't surprising the Wizards could n't overcome the loss of Wall , his replacement , Ramon Sessions , still had a solid showing as a starter . He went 8 - for - 14 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score a playoff career - high of 21 points , while also adding four assists . While he played well , he still did n't have the playmaking ability that Wall is known for , so it was n't enough to propel the Wizards to a win . Bradley Beal was another reason the Wizards were able to come back after a weak first quarter . Beal finished with 20 points ( 8 - 22 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) , five rebounds and seven assists over 43 minutes . Beal has now combined for 48 points , eight assists and four steals over the first two games of this series , so he 's been very effective and should continue as the Wizards head back home to Washington . Both Paul Pierce and Otto Porter reached double figures in points as well . Pierce recorded 15 points ( 5 - 10 FG , 5 - 8 3Pt ) and five rebounds , while Porter chipped in with 15 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) , eight rebounds and five assists off the bench . If Porter can continue to play this well off the bench , he 'll only make this Wizards ' team even more dangerous once Wall returns . The winner of this game of course was the Hawks though , as their frontcourt was dominant . The trio of DeMarre Carroll , Paul Millsap and Al Horford all helped the Hawks ' starting frontcourt to out - score the Wizards ' frontcourt 58 - 27 . Carroll led the team , finishing with 22 points ( 9 - 16 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) , six rebounds and four assists . He continues to be a surprise for the Hawks considering how consistent he 's been throughout the playoffs . He 's now posted six straight games with 20 or more points and is averaging 19 points over eight outings this postseason . He only averaged 13 points during the regular season , so he 's really elevated his play . Millsap and Horford contributed with 18 points a piece . Millsap added 11 rebounds and four steals , while Horford had six assists and three steals . While not something they 're usually known for , the combined steals from both Horford and Millsap helped force the Wizards into sixteen turnovers , while the Hawks committed just 10 of their own . Coming off the bench , Kent Bazemore went a perfect 3 - for - 3 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score 10 points over 17 minutes . These two teams will play next on Saturday in Washington for game number three of this best - of - seven series .

The Warriors ( 2 - 1 ) rode their two biggest stars to victory , as Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry combined for 65 points on a 19 - for - 33 tally from the field . Durant has - - for the moment , at least - - taken the title of team MVP from Curry , as he 's averaged 31 points over his first three contests in a Warriors uniform while playing between 37 and 39 minutes in each . Although Golden State struggled considerably from three - point range as a team - - managing only a 28 percent success rate - - Curry was lights out from beyond the arc , draining five of his eight long - distance attempts .

The Indiana Pacers ( 1 - 3 ) came away with their first victory of the season in Tuesday’s trip to the Palace of Auburn Hills , knocking off the previously undefeated Detroit Pistons ( 3 - 1 ) , 94 - 82 . The Pacers rode the strength of a 220 run in the second quarter to the win , which came after starting center Ian Mahinmi departed the game with a back injury . The frontcourt reserve trio of Jordan Hill , Myles Turner , and Lavoy Allen covered well for Mahinmi’s absence , combining for 20 points , 16 rebounds , and four blocks over 60 minutes . They weren’t the only contributors off the Indiana bench , which outscored its Detroit counterparts by a 43 - 2 margin . Backup guard Rodney Stuckey led the charge with 23 points against his former team . Paul George chipped in 16 points to go along with seven rebounds , five assists , and two steals . On the Detroit side , taking care of the ball proved to be a major issue . The Pistons finished with 23 turnovers against just 14 assists , with point guard Reggie Jackson ( six turnovers ) the most egregious offender . Andre Drummond also turned the ball over on four occasions , but more than made up for it with a super - size double - double of 25 points ( 12 - for - 17 shooting ) and a career - high 29 rebounds . He’s now averaging a Chamberlain-esque 20 boards over the Pistons’ four games . Indiana will head back home for a matchup with the Boston Celtics on Wednesday , while Detroit gets a two - day break before heading out to Phoenix for a game Friday against the Suns .
The Brooklyn Nets ( 5 - 7 ) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder ( 3 - 11 ) 94 - 92 on Friday . Brooklyn continues to sputter along .

The Nets continue their three - game road trip in San Antonio on Saturday against the Spurs . Oklahoma City has lost five straight games . Andre Roberson moved back into the starting lineup at shooting guard , pushing Jeremy Lamb back to a bench role .

The Thunder will stay home and host the Golden State Warriors on Sunday .
The New Orleans Pelicans ( 16 - 27 ) won for the fifth time in six games Saturday with a 116 - 99 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks ( 19 - 27 ) . New Orleans , last season 's Western Conference eighth seed , has been slowly climbing out of the bottom of the standings since the start of the New Year . The win over Milwaukee puts the Pelicans just three games behind the Sacramento Kings in the conference playoff race . Per usual , the Pels owed a large portion of their success on Saturday to the play of superstar Anthony Davis . The fourth - year power forward failed to repeat his starting All-Star honors this season , but has quietly been averaging a double - double with 23 points per game . Davis 's game was nothing short of the ordinary on Saturday , as he posted 22 points while pulling down seven rebounds , dishing out five assists , and blocking four shots . It was forward Ryan Anderson , however , who led the team in scoring with 23 points while coming off the bench . Anderson converted an impressive 6 of 11 shots from beyond the three - point line . The Bucks are now facing a two - game slide after finally seeing a three - game stretch of good luck . Milwaukee currently sits at last in the central division and thirteenth in the Eastern Conference , just one year after a surprising appearance in the playoffs . The Bucks held advantages in rebounding , field - goal shooting , and free - throw shooting over the Pelicans , but were still blown out in large part due to an 18 - 8 disadvantage in the turnover department . Perimeter defense also posed a problem for the Bucks , as New Orleans went an impressive 17 for 31 from beyond the arc . Milwaukee will have two days of rest before hosting the Orlando Magic on Tuesday . New Orleans , meanwhile , will continue their homestand on Monday as they face the Houston Rockets at Smoothie King Center .
The Memphis Grizzlies ( 19 - 17 ) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers ( 15 - 22 ) 91 - 78 on Monday . Damian Lillard ( foot ) returned to the starting lineup after missing the last seven games . The hometown Blazers crowd was ecstatic to have their all star point guard back , but it looks like Lillard will need another game or two to shake the cobwebs off . He finished with 17 points on 4 - of - 14 shooting in 35 minutes . Allen Crabbe returned to his bench role and added nine points and six rebounds , while C.J . McCollum rounded out the backcourt with 16 points , four assists and two rebounds . Turnovers were an issue for the guard rotation throughout the effort , and the Grizzlies slow , physical game plan took advantage of the 22 mistakes Portland committed . Lillard was responsible for seven of the turnovers , but the Blazers are aware of the hindering foot injury and it should not be long before he returns to his elite level of play . Al-Farouq Aminu converted a double - double to lead the frontcourt , adding 15 points and 14 rebounds . Aminu’s career high 11 points per game and 7 rebounds per game are proving to be a strong signing for Portland . The Trail Blazers will host the Los Angeles Clippers ( 22 - 13 ) on Wednesday . Memphis is coming off a tough overtime loss to the Utah Jazz on Saturday , where point guard Mike Conley ( back ) played 41 minutes on a sore back . The day off was spent traveling , but the Grizzlies staple is their tough , physical style of play . The Blazers never came within striking distance and that came on the shoulders of Zach Randolph , who added 26 points and 18 rebounds in 31 minutes off the bench . Jeff Green and Matt Barnes started at the forward positions , but struggled to aid the scoring sheet after combining to go 3 - for - 17 from the field . Conley contributed nine points , four assists and two rebounds , while not allowing a turnover , in 26 minutes . The Grizzlies managed the clock well , took care of the basketball and won the rebounding battle ( 52 - 42 ) to spoil Lillards return and come away with a road win . The Grizzlies tough road trip continues when they face the Oklahoma City Thunder ( 24 - 11 ) on Wednesday .
The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Sacramento Kings , 114 - 104 , Wednesday at AT & T Center . The Spurs ( 50 - 13 ) elected to rest stars Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge for the night , and their impact , or lack thereof , could be felt in the first quarter , as San Antonio fell behind by 22 points after the first 12 minutes of the game and ultimately went into halftime facing a 15 - point deficit . However , the second half was a much different story , as the Spurs ended up winning the second 24 minutes by an astonishing 25 points to bury the visiting Kings ( 25 - 39 ) . Without the two stars , Manu Ginobili managed to turn back the clock and lead the way scoring for San Antonio , recording 19 points , five assists , four rebounds and three steals in 25 minutes off the bench .

David Lee also took advantage of the extended playing time , recording a double - double of 18 points on 8 - of - 9 shooting and 10 rebounds in 31 minutes as a member of the starting lineup . As for the Kings , Tyreke Evans shined in his first start since being traded , scoring a game - high 26 points on 9 - of - 13 shooting from the field . There were n't many other highlights from what turned out to be a disappointing performance from Sacramento , but rookie big man Skal Labissiere continues to show his potential , as he recorded an efficient 15 points on 7 - of - 10 shooting from the field in 15 minutes off the bench Wednesday . Up next , the Spurs will look to extend their winning streak to 10 games in Oklahoma City on Thursday , while the Kings will look to bounce back and end their six - game losing streak Friday against the Wizards .
The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 22 - 9 ) defeated the Orlando Magic ( 19 - 15 ) 104 - 79 on Saturday . The Cavaliers came into the contest tied with the Heat as the stingiest Eastern Conference team in terms of points allowed , yielding only 95 per game . They further cemented their reputation with a suffocation of the Magic 's offense , preventing their starting five from producing a single double - digit scorer . The Cavs made life miserable for Orlando shooting - wise , as the visitors could only muster a 38 percent success rate from the field , and 24 percent figure from beyond the arc . On the offensive end , Cleveland also took excellent care of the ball , committing only six turnovers in contrast to the 14 they forced from the Magic . Orlando was actually led by Aaron Gordon 's 11 points off the bench , which he complemented with seven rebounds and a pair of assists . A pair of 10 - point tallies from Shabazz Napier and Mario Hezonja , who were also in reserve roles , served as the next highest totals . The former added four rebounds , an assist and a steal , while the latter contributed six boards and three assists . Evan Fournier 's nine points paced the starting five , a group that bottomed out with a scoreless effort from Elfrid Payton over 16 minutes .

Golden State has won 15 straight games , and in their last two games , they 've done it without starting center Andrew Bogut who has been sidelined with tendinitis in his knee . David Lee ( hamstring ) is nearing a return but has yet to be cleared to return to action , and even when Lee does return , there does n't seem to be more than a marginal role off off the bench available to him . Stephen Curry led the way with a game - high 29 points Saturday , and he was helped by Draymond Green and Klay Thompson , who both also finished with 20 - plus points . Golden State is playing a back - to - back set . They 'll continue their road trip Sunday in New Orleans against the Pelicans . Bogut had fluid drained from his knee and will sit out Sunday .

Dallas has two days off before going on the road to face the New York Knicks .
The Boston Celtics defeated the host Utah Jazz , 112 - 104 , at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Saturday .

In fact , the Celtics went 24 - of - 36 from the field to lead by 14 points at the half , as it never got within six points from there . It was a wire - to - wire win for Boston , as Utah could n't climb back into the game . The shooting was just as lopsided for the whole game , with the Celtics shooting 59 percent and Utah hitting just 41 percent of their shots . The assist - to - turnover differential was decisive as well , with the Celtics recording four more assists than the Jazz and committing nine less turnovers .

On the opposing side , Nets ' guard Bojan Bogdanovic stepped into a leading role for the shorthanded Nets ' offense . Bogdanovic led the team with 18 points on 8 - of - 11 shooting . Former No . 1 overall pick Anthony Bennett did not enjoy the same success , however , as he shot just 2 - of - 8 from the field .
The Milwaukee Bucks ( 41 - 40 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 18 - 63 ) 107 - 97 on Monday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia . The Bucks continued to gain some steam as the regular season winds down , notching their third straight victory and finishing the season sweep over the Sixers . They 've already locked up the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference standings , so this was another solid momentum builder for the playoffs that start this coming Saturday . The game did get somewhat chippy towards the end though , as both Jerryd Bayless and O.J . Mayo received technical fouls for the Bucks , while Jakaar Sampson picked one up for the Sixers . The Bucks were the superior shooters in this game , going 49 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three - point line , while the Sixers finished at 40 percent from the floor and just 21 percent from deep . Michael Carter-Williams had another strong showing , finishing with 30 points ( 11 - 17 FG , 8 - 13 FT ) , five rebounds , five assists and three steals . Over his last four games , he 's averaged 23 points , six assists and 3 steals , so the Bucks would love to see him stay this hot going into their playoff series with either the Toronto Raptors or Chicago Bulls . Giannis Antetokounmpo had a solid overall game as well , recording 12 points ( 3 - 9 FG , 6 - 10 FT ) , seven rebounds and three assists over 34 minutes . He 'll take season averages of 13 points and 7 rebounds into the Bucks ' final matchup on Wednesday . The only other two players to reach double figures in points were Ersan Ilyasova and O.J . Mayo . Ilyasova finished with 13 points ( 5 - 8 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) and three steals , while Mayo posted 13 points ( 5 - 9 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) , four rebounds and three steals of his own .

Covington went 6 - for - 13 from the field , but just 1 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 25 points , while also adding seven rebounds and four blocked shots . It was n't all good for the forward though , as he turned the ball over a whopping 10 times . He 's played well over these final games other than the turnovers , averaging 24 points over his last three . Thompson , on the other hand , finished with 19 points ( 7 - 18 FG , 3 - 10 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and four rebounds over 36 minutes .

Thomas Robinson and Jakaar Sampson finished in double figures off the bench . Robinson posted 12 points ( 4 - 8 FG , 4 - 6 FT ) and six rebounds , while Sampson had 10 points ( 3 - 8 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) and five rebounds .

Memphis was able to shoot extremely well in this one , as they went 59 percent from the field and a ridiculous 62 percent from the three - point line .

He went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score a season - high of 20 points in 23 minutes . He also had a season - high of 10 rebounds , giving him his first double - double of the year .

He went a perfect 8 - for - 8 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from beyond the arc to score 18 points in only 27 minutes . He had 23 points against the Spurs on Friday and 15 against a tough Rockets team Wednesday , so he 's had a nice stretch of games during the last week . Courtney Lee ( 7 - 9 FG , 3 - 3 3Pt ) and Zach Randolph ( 8 - 15 FG , 1 - 1 FT ) also reached double figures in points with 17 apiece . Marc Gasol was one of the lone players to struggle offensively , as he had only two points in 27 minutes , but he still had six rebounds and seven assists , so it was n't all bad for Gasol . Dwyane Wade had a strong game for the Heat . He went 11 - for - 20 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the free throw line to score 25 points , while also adding six assists . He 's caught fire in the last three games , scoring 28 , 28 and now 25 over that stretch . Wade is now averaging 22 points and 6 assists on the season . Chris Bosh did n't have as big of a game as he 's come accustomed to . He scored 12 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 0 - 2 FT ) and recorded only two rebounds in 35 minutes . It was his first time in nine games not reaching at least 15 points , and only the second time all season grabbing less than five rebounds , so do n't expect him to have this sort of game again any time soon . Mario Chalmers had 12 out of the 19 points from the Heat 's bench , while also notching his second game in row with at least four steals . The rest of the bench really struggled , which may have been the deciding factor in this one . The Grizzlies ' next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday , while the Heat will travel to Phoenix to play the Suns on Tuesday .

The Memphis Grizzlies ( 20 - 18 ) defeated the Denver Nuggets ( 13 - 24 ) 91 - 84 on Friday . Both teams entered the game with their rosters at less than full strength , and the result was a gritty , grind - it - out affair . The visitors were missing stalwart power forward Kenneth Faried , who was out due to the birth of his child , while the Grizzlies had their starting backcourt sidelined . Mike Conley was forced to miss a second consecutive contest with a left Achilles injury , while a hip contusion derailed two - guard Courtney Lee for the night . While the three players ' respective replacements all turned in serviceable efforts , it was some of the team 's most reliable performers that led the way . Denver 's attack was spearheaded by Danilo Gallinari , who managed his second 29 - point outing over the last three contests , and who scored over 20 points for the fourth straight game since returning from a six - game absence due to an ankle injury . Faried 's replacement on the night , Darrell Arthur , was actually the Nuggets ' second leading scorer , managing 12 points , nine rebounds , a pair of assists and a pair of blocks . Gary Harris was the only other starter with double - digit scoring , pouring in 11 points and adding five rebounds , an assist and a steal . Jusuf Nurkic took another positive step in his gradual return to action , collecting six points , six rebounds and a block over 18 minutes off the bench . The Nuggets fell to 13 - 24 and remain in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They head back home and await the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday . Although Memphis saw all five members of their starting unit tally double - digit points , they were actually led in scoring by Zach Randolph , who pitched in 24 points , six rebounds , an assist and three blocks . Jeff Green 's near double - double headed up the starters , with the Grizzlies ' forward contributing 16 points , nine rebounds , two assists and a steal . Frontcourt mate Matt Barnes was right behind him with a stat - sheet - stuffing performance that consisted of 15 points , seven rebounds , three assists and a block . Marc Gasol and Conley 's stand - in for the night , Mario Chalmers , posted a pair of 12 - point efforts . Gasol had a relatively quiet night on the boards with only four rebounds , but dished out a trio of assists and also snatched five steals . Meanwhile , Chalmers had a slow first half , but came on after intermission to finish with 12 points , six rebounds and four assists . Tony Allen did a fine job as Lee 's replacement , finishing with 10 points , nine rebounds , an assist , three steals and a block . The Grizzlies improved to 20 - 18 and remain in third place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They now await the Boston Celtics for Sunday showdown .
The Brooklyn Nets ( 11 - 28 ) defeated the New York Knicks ( 20 - 21 ) 110 - 104 on Wednesday . The Nets secured their first victory under interim head coach Tony Brown - - and broke a 10 - game home losing streak - - with some uncharacteristic offense that included a late 10 - 2 run . Brooklyn had astoundingly failed to reach 90 points in four straight games coming into Wednesday , and had not even managed to hit the 80 - point mark in three of those contests . Meanwhile , New York came in sporting a Top 10 - ranked defensive unit in terms of points allowed , but did learn shortly before game time that superstar Carmelo Anthony would sit out with the ankle sprain that had caused him to leave Tuesday 's showdown with the Celtics early . Despite an outstanding performance from Derrick Williams off the bench that helped make up for a large part of the points Anthony took with him to the bench , it was a resurgent Nets squad that got key contributions from a combination of starters and reserves that helped key the win . Williams did lead the visitors with a season - high 31 - point performance , his best outing since he amassed the same total versus the Mavericks back on December 9 , 2013 while a member of the Sacramento Kings . He also added seven rebounds and a pair of steals over 32 action - packed minutes . Arron Afflalo continued his solid stretch of shooting with 18 points on an 8 - for - 16 effort from the field . He also hauled in three rebounds and added two assists . Jose Calderon made it a productive night for the Knicks backcourt with 16 points , seven rebounds , four assists and a pair of steals . The frontcourt was n't bad either , beginning with rookie sensation Kristaps Porzingis , who tallied a 12 - point , 10 - rebound double - double despite only shooting 5 - for - 17 from the field . Robin Lopez also put together a solid game versus his brother Brook , tallying nine points and 12 boards . The Knicks fell to 20 - 21 and are now in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head to Memphis to face off with the Grizzlies on Saturday . Brooklyn 's attack was , as customary , spearheaded by Brook Lopez , who put up 20 points , eight rebounds , five assists , two steals and a block in an inspired performance against his brother , Robin . The most encouraging effort of the night however , may have been that of Thaddeus Young . Mired in a slump over recent games , Young bounced back with an outstanding 19 - point , 11 - rebound double - double that also included a trio of assists and a trio of steals . It was the first double - double over the last five games for Young , who 'd made such performances the norm at one point earlier in the season . Veteran Joe Johnson stuffed the stat sheet with 14 points , seven rebounds , six assists and a steal . Brown also decided to give the starting backcourt of Wayne Ellington and Donald Sloan an opportunity at redemption after a lackluster first game together , and they responded with slightly better production . The former managed 10 points , a pair of rebounds and a pair of assists , while the latter provided eight points , four rebounds , three assists and a steal . However , Sloan was outplayed by the man he usurped for the starting point guard spot , Shane Larkin , as he paced the Nets ' bench with 17 points , five assists and a pair of rebounds over 25 minutes . The Nets improved to 11 - 28 and continue entrenched in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They remain home for a Friday night match - up against the Portland Trail Blazers .

The Utah Jazz ( 8 - 8 ) came very close to toppling the Golden State Warriors ( 190 ) but the multi - pronged attack of the Warriors had the answer as they earned the victory and stayed perfect by beating the Jazz 106 - 103 . Utah took the lead with 7:30 left in the fourth quarter after an 11 - 2 run but that is when Stephen Curry and the Warriors kicked it into another gear .

The Detroit Pistons defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers , 106 - 101 , at Palace of Auburn Hills on Thursday evening . LeBron James naturally carries a sizable offensive responsibility on his shoulders under normal circumstances , but that goes up exponentially whenever one of his other fellow `` Big Three '' mates is sidelined . That 's currently the case with Kevin Love ( knee ) out indefinitely , and James has unsurprisingly responded with spectacular production . He was at again Thursday , posting a 29 - point , 13 - rebound , 10 - assist triple - double that also included two steals . However , that was n't enough for the Cavaliers ( 42 - 21 ) to prevent their losing streak from extending to three games , despite the fact that Kyrie Irving also poured in 27 points . The Pistons ( 32 - 33 ) countered with six double - digit scoring performances , including one from each of the members of their starting five , on their way to a 47 percent success rate from the field .

The Lakers ( 19 - 37 ) checked in to Friday 's contest with only six road victories in 30 games away from Staples Center this season , so their chances of victory were n't exactly abundant against a Bucks ( 22 - 30 ) squad that had broken even at home over 26 contests .

The entire Jazz first unit had the hot hand , as they shot 55 percent ( 32 - of - 58 ) as a group , with all five players hitting double digits on the scoreboard . The Knicks put on an impressive offensive performance themselves , tallying a 51 percent success rate from the field . Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis combined for 56 points , with each player compiling half , and also had 17 rebounds between them . Derrick Rose registered 18 points , but scoring was scarce from the rest of the roster , with the remaining seven players totaling just 35 points .

After struggling with his shot on Friday against the 76ers , it was good to see him turn things around , and give the Suns their very effective backcourt duo back . Coming off the bench , Isaiah Thomas had a very efficient outing , scoring 18 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and adding five steals . Not really known for his defensive presence , the five steals were a season - high for him . Also , in only 15 minutes , Alex Len scored 10 points ( 5 - 6 FG ) of his own . The Raptors saw an extremely strong showing by Jonas Valanciunas , who posted 21 points ( 9 - 14 FG , 3 - 4 FT ) and 10 rebounds .

Richard Jefferson and Iman Shumpert , the respective replacements for the idle starters , could only muster a combined nine points on 3 - of - 12 shooting , and the Cavs did n't receive any other double - digit scoring efforts besides those of the aforementioned superstars .

The Clippers strategically rested Blake Griffin , Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan , as their playoff seeding is locked in and neither a win or loss would have changed that outcome . The Suns , on the other hand , were looking to close out the season with a win for the hometown fans , and also had little draft positioning to worry about .

The Clippers will meet the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs , while the Suns will look to rebuild in the offseason .
The Houston Rockets defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 129 - 99 Thursday at Smoothie King Center . The Rockets ( 41 - 18 ) wasted no time spoiling the homecoming of the new - look Pelicans ( 23 - 35 ) , as New Orleans only managed to stick around for one quarter , as Houston managed to open up 16 - point lead heading into halftime and never looked back . Leading the way for the Rockets was a player who has only been on the team for a couple of days . In his first game as a Rocket , Lou Williams posted a team - high 27 points in just 25 minutes off the bench . Williams ' only competition for Sixth Man of the Year this season , Eric Gordon , was n't too far behind , scoring 19 points in 30 minutes as a reserve Thursday .

Up next , the Rockets will head home Saturday to take on the Timberwolves , while the Pelicans will look to turn things around Saturday in Dallas .

These are two teams going in opposite directions and that was clearly evident with this result . The Thunder got out to a 14 - point lead after the first quarter and never looked back after that . The assisting and turnovers were the difference in the game , as the Timberwolves really struggled against this potent defense . Minnesota finished the game with 15 assists and 12 turnovers , while Oklahoma City finished with 31 assists and six turnovers . The Timberwolves were one of the surprise stories of the NBA in the first two weeks of the season , but they 've fallen back into lottery obscurity since . After starting the season 4 - 2 , they are now 8 - 27 over their last 35 games . The crazy thing about it is that they continue to start players like Kevin Garnett and Tayshaun Prince with some talented youngsters sitting on the bench . It was their most prized youngster who played well here , as Andrew Wiggins finished the game with 25 points in a solid performance . No other player scored more than 15 points in the loss and it was simply an ugly performance from the Wolves . Minnesota has a good chance at a win in their next game though , when they host the struggling Phoenix Suns on Sunday . The Thunder have beaten the Timberwolves in nearly every game since their move from Seattle to Oklahoma City and the dominance continued here . After being ejected with zero points in his last game , Russell Westbrook bounced back nicely here with his fourth triple - double of the season . The amazing thing is that he did that in just 27 minutes of action . Kevin Durant was no slouch tonight either though , as he finished with 21 points , six rebounds and seven assists in the victory . Neither of those superstars played in the fourth quarter either and that 's a great way to earn your studs some extra rest . Dion Waiters also accumulated some good numbers in garbage time , as he scored 20 points in the win . Oklahoma City has an interesting matchup in their next game , as they host the Miami Heat on Sunday .

The Heat dominated down low , as they won the rebounding differential , 48 - 34 and the points in the paint battle , 54 - 44 . Free-throw shooting really killed Milwaukee , as they went just 16 - of - 28 from the charity stripe . The Heat ( 23 - 30 ) have now won 12 - straight games , as they continue to be the hottest team in the NBA . Hassan Whiteside was the player of the game , as he totaled 23 points and 16 rebounds on 10 - of - 12 shooting .

Giannis Antetokounmpo was the lone bright spot for Milwaukee , as he accumulated 22 points , eight rebounds and two steals . Jabari Parker was the only other starter in double figures , as he amassed 14 points and two assists .

The Brooklyn Nets ( 6 - 15 ) defeated the Houston Rockets ( 10 - 12 ) 110 - 105 on Tuesday . After a roller coaster first 18 games of the season , the Rockets had finally started to build some momentum as of late , coming into Tuesday having won three straight games . However , the recent positive vibes were extinguished in a mistake - laden performance against the Nets . James Harden turned in a particularly disappointing outing , finishing with a season - low 10 points , his fewest since a nine - point effort last February against the Clippers . The All-Star guard also turned the ball over seven times , equaling his second - highest total on the season in that category . Although he was an effective ball distributor Tuesday - - handing out nine assists on the night - - Harden seemed to hurt more than help by not being aggressive offensively , especially after the Rockets lost Trevor Ariza to a bruised lower back in the first quarter . Corey Brewer and Marcus Thornton were the principal beneficiaries of Ariza 's absence , totaling 34 and 26 minutes off the bench , respectively . The former posted a season - high 22 points ( including a season - high four three - pointers ) , along with three rebounds , two assists and three steals . Thornton also managed his best scoring night of the season , amassing 32 points on a season - best 12 field goals and 67 percent shooting from the field . Patrick Beverely and Dwight Howard joined Harden in providing a pair of 10 - point efforts , with the latter coming a rebound short of a double - double . Clint Capela pitched in with a modest six points and nine rebounds . Houston fell to 10 - 12 and currently resides in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They face the Wizards in Washington in the second game of a back - to - back on Wednesday . The Nets were led by their outstanding frontcourt duo of Brook Lopez and Thaddeus Young , which has often been the case this season , but received strong efforts from their entire starting five . Lopez pitched in with 24 points , eight rebounds , and an impressive five blocks . It was the Nets ' big man 's sixth contest with over 20 points over the last eight games . Meanwhile , Young managed his best night of the year from the field , draining 10 - of - 13 shot attempts ( 77 percent ) to post 20 points . By adding 12 rebounds ( along with five assists ) , the veteran tallied his fifth double - double in the last six games . The venerable Joe Johnson also had an outstanding night , equaling a season - high 22 points . Bojan Bogdanovic , making his second start in place of injured rookie Rondae Hollis-Jefferson ( ankle ) , provided 19 points and five rebounds . The second - year pro also sank a season - best three buckets from beyond the arc , an encouraging sign given Bogdanovic 's struggles with his long - range shot so far in the 2015 - 16 campaign . Jarret Jack closed out an excellent night for Brooklyn 's front line by pitching in 10 points and nine assists . The Nets improved to 6 - 15 and reside in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They remain home for a matchup with the last - place Sixers on Thursday .

The game was well out of hand headed to the fourth quarter , as the Thunder had a 21 - point lead . The key for Oklahoma City was the ball movement , as they recorded 27 assists to the Jazz ' 18 . Utah really struggled with their shooting , as they went 23 percent from three - point range and 70 percent from the free - throw line .

No player on Utah scored more than 17 points and the five starters combined for just 34 points . Trey Burke led the team with 17 points off the bench , despite playing just 12 minutes . Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors combined for just 13 points and four rebounds , which is simply too difficult to overcome . On deck for Utah is a matchup against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday . With Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook both approaching triple - doubles , there wasn’t much doubt they 'd lose this game . Durant finished with 20 points , eight rebounds and nine assists , with Westbrook tallying 15 points , seven rebounds and nine assists of his own . Dion Waiters played well off the bench , as he amassed 17 points , three assists and three steals . The Thunder will look to extend their winning streak to seven games against San Antonio Spurs on Saturday .
With Chris Paul and Blake Griffin both sidelined by injuries , it took big play from the Clippers ' backups to come away with the win on Wednesday .

The Raptors ( 44 - 29 ) checked into Saturday 's contest having won four straight games and within striking distance of the top - seeded Cleveland Cavaliers . Meanwhile , the Mavs ( 31 - 41 ) were in urgent need of a win to keep their fading playoff hopes alive , but it was ultimately the road team that prevailed in what was a tough defensive matchup . Toronto managed to shoot just a bit better than Dallas , tallying success rates of 48 and 43 percent from the field and three - point range , respectively . The Mavs fell behind by a 30 - 22 score after one quarter and never could catch up against a suffocating Raptors defense that limited them to 38 percent shooting overall and a 25 percent mark from behind the arc . DeMar DeRozan and Serge Ibaka co - led Toronto with matching 18 - point efforts , with the former providing six assists , three rebounds , a steal and a block , and the latter supplying eight boards and one assist . P.J . Tucker drew the start and produced a near double - double with nine points , nine rebounds , three assists and four steals .

A tale of two halves between a pair of the Western Conference’s best teams , and one that pointed towards a Thunder rout from the get go . Oklahoma City stormed out to a twenty point lead behind Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant , which has been the theme of their season so far . The scoring outbursts from the two all - stars eventually went cold when it mattered most , as Los Angeles rallied behind Wesley Johnson’s three point shooting and superb defense and DeAndre Jordan’s smooth touch at the rim . Chris Paul and company needed a miracle to make the comeback , and that miracle was granted after Jordan made two free throws , as part of two possessions that sent him to the free throw line the old fashioned way . With just under 5:0 remaining in the fourth quarter , Johnson drained back - to - back treys to pull within eight points of the Thunder . Add in a trio of layups from Jamal Crawford , Jordan and Paul ( in that order ) , and the Clippers found themselves down just two points . Kevin Durant broke the cold streak with 2:0 remaining , but the aforementioned Jordan and - 1’s came on the following possessions and the Clippers didn’t look back , capping off the 22 point comeback and resilient victory . Durant led all scorers with 30 points , to go along with 11 rebounds , five assists and five blocks , while Westbrook , who’s shot selection late in the game became strange , finished with 24 points , six rebounds and 12 assists . Serge Ibaka pitched in a double - double with 11 points and 11 boards , and the Thunder bench was led by Enes Kanter’s eight points and eight rebounds . On the Clippers end , it was Paul’s unselfish leadership , as he finished with 21 points , four rebounds and 13 assists . Johnson deserves a lot of credit down the stretch , as he pestered Kevin Durant with fabulous defense , and scored 11 points off the bench . The volume shot selection was not the best of choice , seeing as he took 16 shots , but the ones that fell came at the right time to bail out the 4 - of - 16 shooting . Jordan nailed his free throws when they mattered most and totaled 20 points and 18 rebounds . The Thunder will head north to cap off a brutal back - to - back against the Golden State Warriors ( 54 - 5 ) on Thursday , while the Clippers will enjoy a few days off before hosting the Atlanta Hawks ( 33 - 28 ) on Saturday .
The dynamic duo of Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum led the Hornets to their 11th win in 17 home games , with the former scoring a game - high 22 points and the latter providing 16 . Walker complemented his scoring total with seven rebounds , four assists and a steal and Batum filled out the stat sheet with 13 rebounds , eight assists , three steals and a block . Marvin Williams registered 13 points , Cody Zeller posted nine , and Jeremy Lamb led the second unit with 10 points . Charlotte limited the Heat to 40 percent shooting and induced 16 turnovers . Josh Richardson 's 20 points led Miami . Tyler Johnson and Wayne Ellington supplied 18 and 12 points , respectively , off the bench . Goran Dragic could only muster five points on 2 - of - 11 shooting , while Hassan Whiteside went for eight points and 10 rebounds .
The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Philadelphia 76ers , 122 - 97 , at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Wednesday . This was a lopsided matchup on paper and the Thunder left no doubt with this dominating result . In fact , Oklahoma City held a double - digit lead for the entirety of the second half , while leading by at least 20 points for the whole fourth quarter . Oklahoma City ended up shooting 55 percent from the field , while holding Philly to just 43 percent . The rebounding differential was glaring , with the Thunder winning that battle , 54 - 25 . The 76 points in the paint was also huge for OKC , as that marked a season - high . The Sixers ( 26 - 45 ) continue to play shorthanded and results like this are inevitable with their best player sidelined . Nik Stauskas was a bright spot for Philly , as he led the team with 20 points off the bench . Dario Saric was the best starter , as he accumulated 12 points , two rebounds , two assists and three blocks . Robert Covington matched Saric 's 12 points , adding three rebounds and a block to his tally . Shawn Long finished second on the team , totaling 13 points and six rebounds off the bench . On deck for the Sixers is a road matchup against the Chicago Bulls on Friday . The Thunder ( 41 - 30 ) now have 26 wins at home , as they 've made Chesapeake Energy Arena an absolute fortress . Russell Westbrook set another record , as he became the first ever player to record a triple - double , while not missing a shot . Westbrook finished the game with 18 points , 11 rebounds and 14 assists on 6 - of - 6 from the field . Enes Kanter led the team in scoring , as he provided 24 points and 11 rebounds off the bench . Victor Oladipo accrued 18 points , two rebounds and an assist . Oklahoma City will be off until Sunday , when they face the Houston Rockets on the road .
Kevin Love has had a great start to the 2016 - 17 season and has looked like his old self , averaging 22 points and 11 rebounds per game thus far . His start to January , however , has been anything but great . Tuesday night against the Jazz , Love posted just 12 points and nine rebounds in 37 minutes while shooting a sorry 4 - of - 14 from the field and 2 - of - 6 from behind the arc . When comparing it to the first two months of the season , it would be completely out of character , but when compared to his other games this January , it looks much more normal . In the three games he 's played this month , Love has shot over 33 percent from the field just once and is shooting a woeful 27 percent from behind the arc to start the new year . So , while his numbers look solid - - he 's averaging 17 points and 11 rebounds through those four games - - Love is playing at an alarmingly inefficient rate .
Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker posted over half of the Bucks ' scoring with a combined 23 - of - 34 tally from the floor . They spearheaded a red - hot offense that managed 57 percent shooting , including 60 percent from three - point range . The Bucks notably outscored their hosts by a 67 - 45 margin after intermission . Antetokounmpo registered a game - high 35 points , along with nine rebounds , seven assists , seven blocks and two steals . Parker had 27 points , while rookie Malcolm Brogdon supplied his first career triple - double with 15 points , 12 assists and 11 rebounds . Greg Monroe paced the bench with a 15 - point , 12 - rebound double - double . Butler 's 26 points led Chicago , Robin Lopez provided a 12 - point , 10 - rebound double - double , and Taj Gibson contributed 11 points . Michael Carter-Williams and Dwyane Wade only mustered four and eight points , respectively , and Doug McDermott 's 13 point - effort led the reserves .
The Phoenix Suns ( 15 - 46 ) lost for the15th time in their last 16 games Thursday , falling 108 - 92 to the host Miami Heat ( 35 - 26 ) . Miami 's backcourt of Dwyane Wade and Goran Dragic combined for 52 points in the contest , dropping in 27 and 25 respectively . Wade also contributed seven assists in what was a resounding victory for the Miami squad . Despite the absence of power forward Chris Bosh , who has been sidelined with blood clots , Miami has held steadily onto fourth place in the Eastern Conference . Nights like Thursday certainly help , as Miami shot exquisitely from the field , posting 48 percent including 53 percent from deep . On Phoenix 's side , meanwhile , rookie Devin Booker scored a career - high 34 points in 39 minutes . The 19 - year - old sharpshooter has made a big splash early on in his NBA career , capturing attention for his lights - out shooting and NBA-ready skill set . Despite being one of the youngest rookies , Booker is now just the second member of the 2015 draft class with multiple 30 - point games , joining first overall pick Karl-Anthony Towns . In the absence of injured stars Eric Bledsoe and Brandon Knight , the fresh - faced rookie has been handed the reigns to the offense , a role that he embraced with his team - high 21 shot attempts on Thursday . Booker proved himself as a knockdown shooter , hitting 11 of his shots including three three - pointers and also going 9 - for - 9 from the free - throw line . Another young rising star in Phoenix , third - year center Alex Len , played a team - high 40 minutes and recorded a double - double , dropping in 12 points and pulling down 13 rebounds . It was a resounding loss nonetheless for the Suns , who have quickly become the NBA 's coldest team . With Bledsoe and Knight both inactive , Phoenix looks destined to add another high lottery pick to their already young group of players . The Suns will visit Orlando on Friday to face the Magic , while the Heat will travel to Philadelphia to take on the league - worst 76ers .
The Charlotte Hornets ( 10 - 19 ) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks ( 14 - 15 ) 108 - 101 on Tuesday . Charlotte has won four straight games , and while the wins have come during an easy part of their schedule ( Sixers , Jazz , Nuggets , Bucks ) , the talking heads have tried to fit the narrative of Lance Stephenson ( groin ) sitting out as the reason for the Hornets ' success . Stephenson has missed the last four games , coinciding with the Hornets ' resurgence , and while they have no doubt played remarkably better of late , putting all the blame on one player is misleading . Kemba Walker led with the way Tuesday , putting up a team - high 27 points in 36 minutes . Charlotte will go on the road to face the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday . Milwaukee has dropped two straight and three of their last four games as they struggle to try and fill the hole of Jabari Parker ( knee ) being out for the rest of the season . Brandon Knight tried his best to keep the Bucks in a position to win , putting up a game - high 34 points in 34 minutes . Ersan Ilyasova ( concussion ) returned from nine - game absence , putting up four points and four rebounds in 16 minutes off the bench . Despite dropping a few games recently , the Bucks have stayed competitive every night . They 'll go on the road to face the Atlanta Hawks on Friday .
The Brooklyn Nets ( 12 - 33 ) snapped a six - game losing streak on Sunday with a 116 - 106 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder ( 33 - 13 ) . The win coincidentally ended a seven - game win streak for OKC . Brooklyn sits at fourteenth in the Eastern Conference , leading only the league - worst Philadelphia 76ers ; however , they were able to come away with a win against one of the association 's stronger teams on Sunday . The Nets have been skidding all season , seeing coach Lionel Hollins fired and GM Billy King tender his resignation . On Sunday , they ended a slough of tough losses , advancing their record to 8 - 17 at home on the season . Star big man Brook Lopez caught fire on Sunday , pouring in a team - high 31 points while pulling down 10 rebounds . OKC defensive anchor Steven Adams sat out Sunday 's contest with an injured right elbow , allowing Lopez to take advantage of the defensive shortcomings of backup Enes Kanter . Lopez was aided , however , by the hustle of power forward Thaddeus Young . The veteran pulled down seven offensive rebounds and 14 boards in total , also notching 14 points , three assists , a block , and a steal . For Oklahoma City , the loss comes as a bit of a shock considering the tear that the team had found itself on . The Thunder boast the third - best record in the NBA , trailing only the historically good Warriors and Spurs . For Oklahoma City 's dynamic duo of superstars , Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant , it was business as usual on Sunday . The two combined for 59 points , 22 rebounds , and 14 assists . Both players were named starters for the Western Conference in this year 's All-Star game earlier this week . However , outside of the superstar tandem , only two Thunder players cracked double - digit scoring , recording 10 points apiece . OKC was edged out at the line and on the glass , as they allowed the Nets to pull down 18 offensive boards and 49 in total . The Thunder will try not to let the loss affect them as they travel to Madison Square Garden on Tuesday to take on the Knicks . The Nets , meanwhile , will play host to the Miami Heat on Tuesday .
The Indiana Pacers ( 11 - 5 ) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers ( 2 - 14 ) 107 - 103 on Sunday . The Pacers received more than they likely bargained for from a feistly Lakers squad that perhaps played with a bit more fire than usual , following Kobe Bryant 's announcement earlier in the day confirming his retirement at season 's end . The perennial All-Star appropriately generated some late - game excitement with a clutch three - point shot that closed the deficit for the home team to 104 - 103 with 12 seconds left , but Paul George was able to seal the victory for the Pacers by draining three out of four free - throws in the final 10 seconds . It was fitting that George clinched the hard - fought win , considering that he spearheaded Indiana 's offensive attack once again with 39 points , four rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals over 37 minutes . It marked the third consecutive game that the standout forward has been at 33 points or better , including a 40 - point outing . The backcourt duo of George Hill and Monta Ellis also made solid contributions , with both guards posting double - digit scoring performances . Hill amassed 11 points and complemented it with six rebounds , three assists and a pair of steals , while Ellis pitched in 15 points , six assists and a block . After an up - and - down start to his Pacers tenure , Ellis has now posted double - digit scoring in seven of his last eight games . C.J . Miles had a quiet outing by his recent standards , pouring in only nine points , and Ian Mahinmi rounded out the starting five 's contributions with eight points and 10 boards in another solid game . Rodney Stuckey paced the Indiana reserves with 11 points , seven rebounds and a pair of assists . The Pacers improved to 11 - 5 and currently reside in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They remain in Los Angeles to face off with the Clippers on Wednesday . Outside of his brief moment of fourth - quarter glory , Bryant turned in another absolutely forgettable shooting effort . He shot only 20 percent from the field , needing all of 20 shots to reach his final output of 13 points . He also added four rebounds , three assists and a steal . Meanwhile , Bryant 's heir apparent at his old shooting guard spot , Jordan Clarkson , continued his recent strong play with an outstanding 22 - point , 10 - rebound double - double . Julius Randle , another one of the young stars giving Lakers ' brass and fans hope for the future , tallied his third double - double in the last five games with 11 points and 12 rebounds , with all but one of those boards coming on the defensive glass . D'Angelo Russell continued his inconsistent shooting performances , totaling eight points on 4 - of - 11 from the field , and adding seven rebounds and a trio of assists . Roy Hibbert turned in a serviceable effort at the center spot , collecting eight points and hauling in nine boards . Nick Young surprisingly tied Clarkson for the team scoring lead with an unexpected 22 - point night off the bench , following four consecutive games in which he 'd only mustered single - digit point totals . The Lakers fell to 2 - 13 and currently reside in last place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They head to Philadelphia to face the Sixers on Tuesday .
The Toronto Raptors ( 51 - 24 ) extended their franchise record for wins in a season with a 99 - 95 victory Friday against the host Memphis Grizzlies ( 41 - 35 ) . The Raptors continue to build themselves as a viable contender , remaining within striking distance of the Cleveland Cavaliers for control of the Eastern Conference . The All-Star backcourt of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan has played no small part , of course , as the duo 's members remain the top two scorers on the team . This held true on Friday , as DeRozan led the team and the game with 27 points , complemented by Lowry 's 22 . Center Jonas Valanciunas , meanwhile , came up big with 14 rebounds and a whopping seven blocked shots . All in all , it was a solid yet narrow win for the Raptors , who have built momentum heading into the postseason . Memphis , meanwhile , is quickly falling in the standings after what has now been a five - game skid . The absence of star center Marc Gasol has been a difference - maker , and will potentially put the Grizzlie 's fifth spot in the West in jeopardy . Memphis shot just 41 percent from the field on Friday , a significantly lower mark than their opponents were held to . Veteran big Zach Randolph offered up 16 points , but did so on just 6 - for - 18 shooting . Things look bleak for Memphis as the team remains riddled with injuries going forward . The Raptors will face one of the toughest matchups in the association on Saturday as they face the Spurs in San Antonio . The Grizzlies , meanwhile , will host the Orlando Magic on Sunday .
The Oklahoma City ( 28 - 12 ) defeated the Dallas Mavericks ' ( 22 - 18 ) benchwarmers 108 - 89 on Wednesday . The Thunder came into this game as huge favorites as Dallas rested all five starters after an overtime game on Tuesday . That left the Mavericks extremely shorthanded and they simply couldn’t score enough to keep pace with the Thunder . They trailed by 23 points at the half and it never got much closer after that . Oklahoma City is one of the best rebounding teams in the NBA and that was the difference here , as the Thunder pulled down 54 boards to the Mavericks ' 41 . Dallas essentially decided to sacrifice a game to give their veterans a day off . The team really struggled with its long distance shooting , going 6 for 31 from three - point range . J.J. Barea carried the load in the loss , as he finished with 18 points and six assists . The candidate for surprise line of the night was Salah Mejri , who tallied 17 points and nine rebounds , which both surpassed his season totals in those statistics . Look for all the regulars to be back on Friday for their next game against the Chicago Bulls . The Thunder were expected to dominate here and they took care of business . If there was one blemish here , it would be that Russell Westbrook was ejected in the second quarter for accumulating two technical fouls . He failed to score for only the second time in his career . Kevin Durant stepped up his game in Westbrook 's absence , though , scoring 29 points while snatching down 10 rebounds . Serge Ibaka also had a nice 20 - point , 11 - rebound double - double as well . The Thunder will be big favorites in their next game as well when they play host to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday .
The New York Knicks ( 18 - 19 ) took down the Miami Heat ( 21 - 14 ) on Wednesday , 98 - 90 , in a battle of two of the Eastern Conference 's most improved teams . The Knicks became the first team in the league to match their win total from 2014 - 15 on Tuesday , as defeated the Hawks for their 17th win of the season . New York has now won three in a row , and sits just one game shy of .500 . The Knicks ' efforts were bolstered , as always , by the play of superstar Carmelo Anthony . After posting a big double - double in Atlanta , Melo continued to shine as he dropped in 25 points to go with five rebounds and four assists . Offseason acquisition Robin Lopez also posted an impressive 19 points on 9 - for - 12 shooting . Highly-publicized rookie Kristaps Porzingis , however , had an underwhelming night , posting just 10 points and four rebounds on 3 - of - 10 shooting . The rookie got off to a ridiculously hot start to the season , but slowed down a bit starting in early December . The Heat had been carrying a three game win - streak headed into their matchup against New York . Miami , who missed the playoffs for the first time in seven years last season , now sits well above .500 and leads the Southeast Division . Perennial All-Star Chris Bosh lit it up for Miami against New York , knocking down 12 shots for 28 points . Ultimately , Bosh 's efforts were n't enough for the Heat to get past Melo and the Knicks , however . Miami will look to turn things around on Friday as they travel to Phoenix to take on the struggling Suns . For the Knicks , on the other hand , maintaining the win streak will be difficult , as they travel to San Antonio on Friday to face off against the Spurs . San Antonio remains a perfect 200 at home .
The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Utah Jazz 88 - 75 at Staples Center on Sunday . As with many contests involving the Jazz , the game was largely a defensive slugfest , with each team counting an 18 - point effort as the high - water mark among their respective first units . Blake Griffin and George Hill did the honors for the Clippers ( 20 ) and Jazz ( 1 - 2 ) , respectively , and Austin Rivers , Jamal Crawford and Dante Exum were the only other players on either side to tally double digits in the scoring column . DeAndre Jordan , despite mustering only seven points , did make a key contribution to the hard - fought victory by bringing down 16 boards in a tough matchup against Rudy Gobert . Hill added three assists , two rebounds and two steals to his team - high scoring total . Gobert turned in a near double - double with eight points and nine rebounds , and he also produced three assists and two blocks . Joe Johnson and Rodney Hood struggled throughout the night on offense , combining for 12 points on 5 - for - 19 shooting . Exum paced the reserves with 10 points , which he complemented with two rebounds , two assists and a steal . Griffin 's final stat line consisted of 18 points , 10 rebounds , an assist and a steal . Chris Paul was close to a double - double himself , supplying nine points , nine assists , three rebounds and four steals . J.J. Redick managed only nine points but no other stats , while Rivers ' bench - leading effort consisted of 19 points , two rebounds and an assist . Crawford produced 12 points , a rebound , an assist and a steal as the second - leading scorer among the reserves . The Jazz head to San Antonio for a Tuesday night tussle , while the Clippers remain home to face off with the Suns on Monday night .
The Miami Heat ( 32 - 24 ) defeated the Indiana Pacers ( 30 - 26 ) in a potential playoff preview matchup Monday at American Airlines Arena , 101 - 93 in overtime . Dwyane Wade sunk a pair of free throws with four seconds left to give Indiana an 88 - 87 lead , but he fouled Monta Ellis on the other end with less than a second remaining to give the Pacers a chance to end it in overtime . Ellis missed the first , however , and the game went to overtime . The Heat sunk the first three field goals of overtime and never trailed in the extra period as they pulled out the victory . Goran Dragic led the Heat with 24 points ( 10 - 17 FG ) and added eight rebounds and five assists . Hassan Whiteside played 41 minutes off the bench and scored 19 points , grabbed 18 rebounds and blocked six shots . Justice Winslow filled up the box score as he earned big minutes in overtime , as he scored 15 points , grabbed seven rebounds , dished four assists and swiped four steals . The Heat pulled off the victory despite awful shooting , as they mustered just 38 - 100 from the floor and 2 - 13 from three - pont land ( 15 percent ) . Paul George led all scorers with 31 points ( 11 - 24 FG , 4 - 7 3PT ) and added 11 rebounds , four assists and three steals . Myles Turner scored 16 points and added five rebounds and two blocks , but fouled out in overtime . Ian Mahinmi was the only other Pacers starter in double figures , as he scored 11 points on 3 - 5 shooting . The Pacers missed nine free throws , including Ellis 's critical last - second front - end miss , and shot just 64 percent ( 16 - 25 ) from the line . The Pacers return home to host the Knicks on Wednesday . The Heat continue their homestand Wednesday against Golden State .
It 's been a rough , potentially final year for Dirk Nowitzki , who has spent majority of this season nursing a sore Achilles . But Monday night against the Timberwolves , the Mavericks organization saw the Nowitzki they had grown so accustomed to seeing for the 18 years he has been with the franchise . The German finished with a season - high 26 points on top of five rebounds and four assists in 31 minutes . It was a performance Nowitzki had n't had since the very first game of this season , when he scored 22 points and eight rebounds in 38 minutes . On top of that , Monday 's performance was just the second time this season where he was able to shoot over 50 percent from the field . In the end , the good news for the Mavericks is that while his performance against Minnesota feels like an outlier as of now , Nowitzki appears to be trending in the right direction , having scored in double figures in five straight games .
The Washington Wizards ( 28 - 13 ) beat the Brooklyn Nets ( 17 - 24 ) , 99 - 90 . The teams split a back - to - back , home - and - home series with each team winning on the road . Kevin Garnett played both games of a back - to - back set for the first time since December 26th and 27th , tallying a team - high 10 rebounds in 27 minutes . Bradley Beal almost registered a triple - double , finishing with 17 points , nine rebounds , eight assists , one steal and two three - pointers in 39 minutes . Marcin Gortat , Nene Hilario , Kevin Seraphin , and Kris Humphries all scored in double figures . The Wizards struggled from the free - throw line , sinking 14 - of - 27 shots overall . They now hold a one - game advantage over the Toronto Raptors for second place in the Eastern Conference Jarrett Jack kept the Nets in the game with a team - high 22 points , eight assists , four rebounds , and one steal but did turn the ball over five times . Backup center Brook Lopez chipped in 15 points in 27 minutes , grabbing five rebounds in the process . The team struggled from deep , converting 4 - of - 17 three - pointers , and now hold a one - game led over the Charlotte Hornets and Detroit Pistons for eighth place in the Eastern Conference . The Nets do n't play again until Wednesday when they begin a three - game Western Conference road trip against the Sacramento Kings . The Wizards take on the Philadelphia 76ers this Monday afternoon .
The Boston Celtics took care of the New Orleans Pelicans 111 - 93 on Monday night . The game was tied at 25 - 25 after the first quarter , but it was never close after that . The difference in the game was as simple as shooting , as the Celtics shot 50 percent from the field , while the Pelicans shot just 41 percent . New Orleans came into this game with more talent and the Celtics came in with better teamwork and it 's clear that the teamwork prevailed here . The New Orleans starters really killed this team as they were outscored by the Celtics starter 70 - 27 in the loss . Boston continues to surprise fans with their efficient play . They won this game in relatively easy fashion thanks to a great team effort . Isaiah Thomas once again led the team with 22 points and five assists . Jared Sullinger did grab a season - high 20 rebounds in the win and that 's a great sign after his recent struggles . Kelly Olynyk also had a good game off the bench , as he tallied 22 points , three rebounds , three assists , two blocks and two steals in the victory . Boston will have a much better test when they host the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday in their next game . Anthony Davis scored 16 points , but aside from that , the rest of the starting - five was a nightmare on Monday . The other four starters combined for just 11 points and had a terrible plus - minus . Ryan Anderson had another nice game off the bench though , as he collected 18 points and nine rebounds in the loss . This is yet another 110 - plus points allowed and that 's been the issue all season long , as they rank dead - last in points allowed this season . New Orleans will have a few days off to think about this terrible performance , when they host the Washington Wizards on Friday in their next scheduled game .
The San Antonio Spurs ( 39 - 7 ) throttled the Houston Rockets ( 25 - 23 ) 130 - 99 on Wednesday night . San Antonio was clearly angry after their 30 - point loss on Monday to the Golden State Warriors and they let out their frustrations on the Rockets here . This was a thorough domination , as they won each of the first three quarters by at least six points and carried a 20 - point lead into half and a 29 - point lead into the fourth quarter . The Spurs shot 56 percent from the field and 52 percent from three - point range in another shooting exhibition . That successful shooting can be credited to the assist margin , as San Antonio dished out 34 assists to Houston 's 14 . The Rockets were 9 - 3 over their last 12 games , but this is a different animal against the Spurs . Not only did they allow the Spurs to shoot nearly 60 percent from the field , they only made 38 percent of their shots . The only notable line was a 20 - point outing from James Harden , but he still committed five turnovers and only dished out two assists in a down game . Dwight Howard did return here after a three - game absence , as he fell just shy of a double - double in 23 minutes of play . No other player on the roster scored more than 11 points besides those two and the hack - a - Caplea strategy on Clint Capela became a huge issue as well , as he went just 3 - for - 10 from the free - throw line . It doesn’t get much easier in Houston 's next game either , as they take on the Oklahoma City Thunder on the road on Friday . Although the Spurs last loss cracked a 13 - game winning streak , this win extended their home winning streak to an incredible 25 games . What 's most impressive about their home form is that they are defeating teams by nearly 20 points a game on average . Tonight was LaMarcus Aldridge 's night , as he tallied 25 points , 10 rebounds and five assists in the victory . Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard also played well , as they scored 18 points a piece . Even though Tim Duncan didn’t play , the other four starters stepped up by combining for 76 points in just three quarters of action . Up next for San Antonio is a fantastic game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday .
The Detroit Pistons ( 11 - 9 ) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks ( 7 - 13 ) 102 - 95 on Friday . The game featured another entertaining showdown between two of the best rebounding centers in the NBA , Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond . Monroe posted a second double - double in two tries against his former Pistons teammates , tallying 14 points and 13 rebounds . However , Drummond responded with 17 points and a massive 23 boards . Despite the Detroit big man 's individual statistical superiority over his former frontcourt mate , Milwaukee easily won the overall battle down low , tallying 50 points in the paint ( compared to Detroit 's 34 ) and outrebounding them 51 to 46 . The Bucks were led by Khris Middleton 's 21 points , and the Milwaukee guard added five rebounds and three assists . O.J . Mayo bounced back from a nightmarish two - point performance Wednesday to total a season - high 13 points , along with five rebounds , four assists and a steal . Giannis Antetokounmpo came within a rebound of a double - double , collecting 12 points and hauling in nine boards . Jerryd Bayless ironically could not muster the same type of production in a start as compared to when he comes off the bench , totaling nine points , five assists and three rebounds . Jabari Parker paced the Bucks ' bench , amassing 10 points and five rebounds . Milwaukee fell to 7 - 13 and remains in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They head home for a Saturday showdown with Knicks . In addition to Drummond 's mammoth outing , the Pistons greatly benefited from a pair of 23 - point efforts from Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris . The former complemented his scoring with five assists , a rebound and a steal , while the latter added to his second consecutive 20 - point performance with four rebounds , three assists and a steal . Veteran forward Ersan Ilyasova , apparently beginning to hit his stride offensively , posted his third consecutive double - digit scoring game ( 13 points ) . Stanley Johnson led the Pistons reserves with 10 points . Detroit improved to 11 - 9 but remains in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They remain home for a date with the Lakers on Sunday .
In their first of two matchups against the Boston Celtics ( 1 - 2 ) this season , the San Antonio Spurs prevailed with a 95 - 87 win in Boston . First-year Spur LaMarcus Aldridge led the charge with 24 points , 12 rebounds , and five assists . The All-Star forward took advantage of the weak play of the Celtics ' big men , also tallying a block and a steal in 35 minutes of play . The game was a bounceback for Aldridge , who posted scoring totals of 11 and 10 in his first two games . San Antonio 's froncourt was also bolstered by the performance of 24 - year - old forward Kawhi Leonard , who totaled 19 points and five rebounds to go along with a pair of steals and a block . Despite falling behind early , Boston was able to remain within reach throughout the game , due largely to the performances of a number of bench players . Backup big men Amir Johnson and Jared Sullinger provided a spark of the bench , recording ten points apiece . While sixth man Isaiah Thomas struggled with his shot , he was still able to contribute as a distributor , notching five assists in the game . The team as a whole had issues with efficiency , as they shot just 36 percent from the field through four quarters . Despite their rough shooting night , sophomore guard Marcus Smart proved a diamond in the rough for Boston , posting 17 points and showing off his highly - touted defense with four steals .

The Oklahoma City Thunder ( 26 - 11 ) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 117 - 113 on Friday night . The prior results from this particular matchup would have indicated a Thunder blowout , but this was one of the most exciting games of the night . In fact , Oklahoma City won its first two games against the Lakers by a combined 75 points , but couldn’t slow them down here . The Thunder simply made some big plays late that carried them to a win with very little to differentiate the two teams . Both teams shot right around 50 percent from the field and the pace was incredible throughout . Oklahoma City is one of the three - best rebounding teams in the NBA and that was the difference here , as they recorded 45 boards to the Lakers 34 .

Westbrook flirted with a triple - double by amassing 36 points , 12 rebounds and seven assists in the win . Durant scored 24 points while snatching down seven rebounds as well . This marks Oklahoma City 's fourth - straight road win and that 's a great sign with their road struggles earlier in the season . The Thunder will look to keep the good times rolling on Sunday against the Portland Trail Blazers . The Lakers played much better here than most people expected and fans have to be encouraged with the recent play . Lou Williams was just majestic late in this game , as he scored 23 fourth quarter points en route to a career - high 44 points in the game . What was most impressive is that he went 15 - for - 15 from the free - throw line . Kobe Bryant also played very well , as he tallied 19 points , four rebounds and six assists . The bench was yet again a disappointment , as no player scored in double - figures . The best part about this loss was the fight that the Lakers showed , as they played hard throughout and battled against a team who killed them in their first two games . Los Angeles next game will be on Sunday against the Utah Jazz .
The Sacramento Kings ( 17 - 23 ) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers ( 26 - 14 ) at Staples Center on Saturday , 110 - 103 . Sacramento battled through foul trouble early on , but shot lights out from the behind the arc to sink the Clippers and their 10 game winning streak . The importance of 3 - point shooting continues to surge in the NBA , and efficient shooting from deep is becoming a sure fire way to stop even the best of teams . The Kings finished 52 percent from the 3 - point line , knocking down 13 treys on route to a tough road win . Omri Casspi nailed five threes , adding 17 points in 30 minutes off the bench . DeMarcus Cousins went into beast mode during the first half , and was unstoppable on the glass and in the paint . As the game progressed to the second half , Cousins picked up three fouls in the 3rd quarter , which dented his strong overall performance . The Kings center finished with 19 points , 13 rebounds , six assists and two blocks on 6 - of - 14 shooting . Rudy Gay added to an impressive streak of five games ( 22 points per game and 7 rebounds per game ) , totalling 18 points and seven rebounds .

The Kings will continue to battle for a playoff spot in the Western Conference when they visit the Los Angeles Lakers ( 9 - 33 ) on Wednesday . While the Clippers have been playing extraordinarily well without Blake Griffin ( quad ) and DeAndre Jordan ( illness ) , the continued absence took full effect at home on Saturday . The 3 - point shots were guarded well by the Kings , and the long ball was the Clippers key to success throughout the streak . JJ Reddick and Chris Paul led the way from deep and finished with 22 points and 15 points , respectively . and combined to go with 8 - of - 14 shooting from 3 - point territory . Cole Aldrich has stepped up in the absence of the all - star front court for the Clippers and added another big performance when they need it most . Aldrich scored 19 points and grabbed 10 rebounds , and the extended playing time has seen improved pick - and - roll play between him and Chris Paul , while also playing a role in opening up JJ Reddick and Paul Pierce to roam around and find better looks . The Clippers will look to bounce back when they host the Houston Rockets ( 21 - 20 ) on Monday .
The Portland Trail Blazers ( 39 - 36 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 29 - 45 ) 105 - 93 at Moda Center on Monday .

Portland continues to exceed expectations in the Western Conference , and they currently hold the 6 - seed for the playoff picture , with the 5 - seed within reach . As a unit , the Blazer shot 14 - of - 29 from behind the arc and moved the ball around the perimeter in supreme fashion , as they assisted each other 25 times . Allen Crabbe was the unusual standout off the bench and led his team in scoring with 21 points . Damian Lillard and C.J . McCollum combined for 29 points , 12 assists and three rebounds , Al Farouq Aminu added 14 points and eight boards . Once the starters handled business through the first three quarters , the Kings were able to take advantage of a merry go - round bench in the fourth quarter , but even Portland’s lowly 14 fourth quarter points were enough to hold off any kind of comeback . Sacramento has all but fallen by the wayside in the Western Conference , and given a night where pretty much every Kings starter did not play , Seth Curry rose above the rest to have a solid performance in his third consecutive start . Curry scored a career - high 21 points , to go along with four rebounds , one assists and two steals in 34 minutes of action . The younger brother of the reigning MVP even flashed his range , as he went 3 - of - 6 from behind the arc . Most of the starters saw 30 - plus minutes of action , and the Kings only went eight players deep , but all five starters finished in double figures . The Blazers defense proved too much too handle , which made sense given the firepower that coach Terry Stotts had at his disposal without having to face DeMarcus Cousins or Rajon Rondo . The Kings will welcome the Washington Wizards ( 36 - 37 ) on Wednesday , while the Blazers will look to catch the Memphis Grizzlies in the playoff race when they host the Boston Celtics ( 43 - 30 ) on Thursday .

They 'll look to bounce - back against the Charlotte Hornets ( 1 - 3 ) on Thursday .
The Washington Wizards defeated the New York Knicks , 119 - 112 , at Verizon Center on Thursday .

The Chicago Bulls ( 31 - 30 ) defeated the Houston Rockets ( 30 - 32 ) 108 - 100 in All-Star Jimmy Butler 's first game back from injury . Butler posted 24 points , 11 rebounds , and six assists to help lead the Bulls past the struggling Rockets . Butler was one of the NBA 's hottest players in January before missing an extended period of time , allowing the Bulls to slip out of the Eastern Conference playoff picture . Butler was not the biggest story , however , as big man Pau Gasol led the team with 28 points and 17 rebounds . The star also notched pairs of blocks and steals on the defensive end , ultimately dominating the low post enough to push Chicago over the top on Saturday . 36 points from James Harden did n't make a difference on Saturday , as the Rockets fell to the faltering Bulls . The All-Star delivered five rebounds and eight assists as well , but could not compensate for the rest of his team 's struggles .

Nicolas Batum was n't too far behind , scoring 21 points in 43 minutes . In the end , however , it was Charlotte 's defensive effort that guided them to victory , as the team tallied up 10 steals and forced the opposition into 15 total turnovers . Their opposition , the Pacers ( 32 - 30 ) , struggled mightily offensively outside of their star Paul George , who finished with a game - high 36 points on 15 - of - 25 shooting from the field , 10 rebounds and five assists in 36 minutes . Unfortunately for Indiana , those 36 points were nearly half of the team 's total points , and his teammates were ice cold from the field . Outside of George , the Pacers shot 22 - of - 56 ( 39 percent ) from the field , and their inability to support their start ultimately cost them Monday 's game . Up next , the Hornets will travel to Miami on Wednesday to take on the surging Heat , while the Pacers will look to bounce back Wednesday against the Pistons .
The Houston Rockets ( 33 - 32 ) defeated the host Boston Celtics ( 39 - 27 ) 102 - 98 , Friday evening at TD Garden .

The Rockets have now won three straight on the road , including victories against top eastern teams , Toronto and now Boston . The Celtics had won their previous 14 games at TD Garden and had won seven of nine against the West coming into this game , but the Rockets managed to defy those trends as they snuck away with the win . Houston struggled shooting from deep in this one , hitting only 5 - 26 from long range and gave up 18 turnovers on the game ; but on the other hand managed to keep the Celtics to just 37 percent shooting from the field .

Beasley tallied 18 points ( 9 - 19 FG ) and eight rebounds , in only 15 minutes , as the second highest scorer for the Houston . Dwight Howard was solid in the middle , with 12 points and 12 rebounds , in 35 minutes . Despite playing at home where they have had great success , the Celtics were not able to gather much momentum in this one . The Celtics averaged 112 points per game throughout their previous 14 home victories but were held much below that mark by a hungry Houston team .

The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 53 - 29 ) defeated the Boston Celtics ( 40 - 42 ) 113 - 100 on Sunday at Quicken Loans Arena in their first meeting of the first round of the Eastern Conference Playoffs . It was the Kyrie Irving show on Sunday , as he hit shot after shot in his NBA playoffs debut . Not only was he hitting shots , but he was making all the tough ones as well , including a three - pointer with a hand in his face at the buzzer to end the first half , putting the Cavaliers up 62 - 54 at the break . Irving went 11 - for - 21 from the field and 5 - for - 9 from the three - point line to finish with a game - high of 30 points , while also adding three rebounds and two assists . His performance erased any doubts of how he 'll play during his first trip to the NBA playoffs . As a team , the Cavaliers shot 45 percent from the field and 42 percent from the three - point line , while the Celtics finished at 47 percent from the floor and 36 percent from deep . Irving received a ton of help from the other two members of the `` Big Three '' , as both LeBron James and Kevin Love had strong showings . Like Irving , this also marked Love 's NBA playoff debut and he made it count with 19 points ( 5 - 14 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 7 - 8 FT ) and 12 rebounds . His 12 rebounds helped give the Cavaliers a 46 - 34 rebounding advantage over the Celtics . James , on the other hand , finished with 20 points ( 8 - 18 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) of his own , to go along with six rebounds , seven assists and two steals . James did n't have to take this game over like he has in years past due to the impressive performance from Irving . With Irving having such a big game , James was able to focus on getting his teammates involved , as his seven assists were a team - high . The Cavaliers also received a solid contribution from their bench , as Tristan Thompson chipped in with 12 points ( 4 - 6 FG , 4 - 6 FT ) and six rebounds in 26 minutes of tough play . Like he 's done ever since joining the Celtics , Isaiah Thomas was again the most productive player for Boston . Thomas went 6 - for - 14 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 22 points , while also adding five rebounds and 10 assists in 32 minutes off the bench . Thomas had n't posted double figure assists even once previously this season , so the double - double was a very nice surprise for this team , despite taking the loss . Thomas will need to continue to play like this if the Celtics want any chance in this series , but he 'll need to get more production from others , as he did n't get much help Sunday . Kelly Olynyk did everything he could to help Thomas and had a strong first half , but slowed down in the second to finish with 12 points ( 5 - 7 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt ) and two blocked shots off the bench . Both Evan Turner and Brandon Bass reached double figures in points as well . Turner finished with 12 points ( 4 - 12 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) , seven rebounds and five assists , while Bass added 10 points ( 3 - 6 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) and two assists . The Celtics came out in the first quarter playing extremely hard and looking like the more motivated team , but they were n't able to hold off the more talented and experienced Cavaliers , who eventually got into a groove and were just too much for the Celtics . These two teams will play again on Tuesday in Cleveland .

However , Sacramento crawled its way back on the strength of rousing fourth - quarter performances from Marco Belinelli , Rudy Gay and DeMarcus Cousins to tie the game at 96 with 13 seconds remaining on a Belinelli 23 - foot three - point basket . After Deron Williams sank a jumper with two seconds left in regulation , Dallas appeared to have sealed the win . However , a driving layup by DeMarcus Cousins at the buzzer sent the game into its first extra period . After an initial overtime that saw both teams fail to score after Dirk Nowitzki tied matters up at 104 with 30 seconds remaining , they battled through a second extra period , with the Kings taking a 116 - 109 advantage with 1:20 on the clock .

Despite a huge late game effort , the Mavericks just did n't have enough left in the tank to finish the comeback and suffered a tough three - point loss in front of their home fans . The Hawks received a huge effort from their starting five in this one , with all reaching double - digits in points . Dennis Schroder led the team with 22 points and six assists , going 9 - for - 15 from the field and 4 - for - 8 from the free throw line .

Alan Williams finished second on the team , providing 17 points , 15 rebounds , three assists and three steals off the bench . Eric Bledsoe finished with 11 points , four rebounds , nine assists and a pair of blocks and steals . Giannis Antetokounmpo was the player pf the game , as he tallied 28 points , eight rebounds , six assists and two blocks on 11 - of - 13 shooting . Michael Beasley finished second on the team , scoring 17 points on 8 - of - 10 shooting off the bench . Greg Monroe also played well off the bench , providing 14 points , eight rebounds , three assists , three steals and two blocks .
The Chicago Bulls defeated the Toronto Raptors , 105 - 94 , at United Center on Tuesday . The Bulls ( 27 - 29 ) had looked rather hapless on Sunday against the Timberwolves while playing with a significantly short - handed squad . Jimmy Butler , Dwyane Wade , Nikola Mirotic and Paul Zipser all missed that contest , and matters did n't look much more optimistic heading into Tuesday 's tilt . However , Butler was able to ultimately make a return from his heel injury , and his presence unsurprisingly made a considerable impact . The star forward posted a 19 - point , 12 - assist double - double that also included two rebounds and four steals over a full allotment of 38 minutes , and Doug McDermott actually led Chicago with a 20 - point effort off the bench . The Bulls also overcame 17 turnovers by shooting a solid 48 percent from the field and 41 percent from three - point range . The Raptors ( 32 - 24 ) were led by Kyle Lowry , who produced 22 points , four assists , three rebounds and one steal . DeMar DeRozan followed with 18 points , five rebounds , three assists and one steal . Norman Powell generated 13 points , four assists , two rebounds and two steals . Jonas Valanciunas posted a near double - double of 12 points and nine boards . Cory Joseph was productive as a reserve as well with 10 points , four rebounds , one assist and one steal . McDermott added five rebounds and one assist to his aforementioned team - high scoring total . Taj Gibson managed 14 points and four boards . Rajon Rondo was next with 12 points , four assists and three rebounds . Cristiano Felicio supplied 10 points , six rebounds , one assist and two steals . Michael Carter-Williams and Robin Lopez registered matching eight - point efforts on the starting five . The Raptors head back home to face the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday evening , while the Bulls remain home to take on the Boston Celtics on Thursday night .
Despite big performances from DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay , the Kings were unable to overcome a rash of turnovers as they fell to the Brooklyn Nets by a score of 107 - 99 on Monday . The Nets benefitted from the Kings ' turnover troubles , scoring 25 points off of 21 turnovers . Brooklyn scored 11 unanswered points to secure a 13 - point lead at the half . The Kings cut the lead to six points late in the fourth , but were unable to close the gap down the stretch . Cousins posted the third double - double of his last four games . Gay scored a game - high 25 points , giving him back - to - back games with over 20 points . The Kings will travel to Boston to take on the Celtics on Wednesday . The Nets enjoyed a big performance from Mason Plumlee , who scored a team - high 22 points in 33 minutes and added four rebounds . Brook Lopez and Deron Williams played 12 and 17 minutes off the bench respectively . Lopez finished with 11 points and six rebounds , a modest line that is signigicant only because he failed to score in double figures in his three previous games since returning from injury . The Nets will travel to Chicago to take on the Bulls on Tuesday .
The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers , 112 - 100 , at Staples Center on Saturday afternoon . The Clippers ( 40 - 26 ) were looking to extend a recent winning stretch that had seen them emerge victorious in three of their previous four games , but knew they 'd have a challenge in the form of the considerably improved Sixers ( 23 - 42 ) . That came to fruition throughout the first three - plus quarters , as Philadelphia actually entered the fourth period in possession of a 79 - 75 advantage . However , Los Angeles came alive at that point , outscoring their visitors by a 37 - 21 margin in the final 12 minutes to secure the double - digit win . Four members of the Clippers first unit managed to score in double digits , and Chris Paul led the way with a game - high 30 points on 11 - for - 16 shooting , along with seven assists , three rebounds and two steals . The Sixers were led by 24 points off the bench from Richaun Holmes , a total he supplemented with nine rebounds . Dario Saric paced the first unit with 16 points , five rebounds , two assists and one block . Jahlil Okafor managed 14 points , four boards , four assists and three steals . Robert Covington tallied 13 points , six rebounds and three steals . T.J. McConnell generated nine points , 10 assists , one rebound and two steals . Timothe Luwawu-Cabbarot matched McConnell 's scoring total and added five rebounds , one assist and one steal . DeAndre Jordan followed Paul with a 19 - point , 20 - rebound double - double that also included four assists , one steal and three blocks . Blake Griffin turned in a 15 - point , 10 - rebound double - double that also featured six assists and three steals . J.J. Redick played an effective complementary role , pouring in 12 points and adding two rebounds , two assists and two steals . Mareese Speights led the second uniit with 11 points , two boards and one assist . The Sixers remain in California to take on the Lakers on Sunday evening , while the Clippers head to Utah for a Monday night tilt versus the Jazz .
The Miami Heat ( 8 - 4 ) held off the Philadelphia 76ers ( 0 - 14 ) to win 96 - 91 on Saturday . This was the Sixers best chance at a win all season , but they couldn’t quite hold off the Heat . Miami ended the game on a 20 - 4 run and held the Sixers to one basket over the final seven - plus minutes . Not to mention , that one basket was a meaningless one with just seconds left in the game . The Heat held the Sixers to 38 percent shooting and blocked 14 shots in the win . Philadelphia 's bench was a bright spot though , as they outscored Miami 's bench 47 to 26 . This was a rough loss in a disastrous season for Philadelphia . They had a big lead early , but simply couldn’t hold on . They did get two great bench performances , as Robert Covington dropped 21 points while Isiah Caanan dropped 22 points . Philadelphia 's best player on this night was rookie Jahlil Okafor , who tallied 16 points , 11 rebounds and three steals en route to a double - double . The rookie now leads the team in scoring and is second on the team in rebounding . They might have their best chance at a win when they take on the equally - young Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday . The Heat looked horrible in the first half , but leaned on their stifling defense to pull out a big win . Miami got an outstanding performance from Dwyane Wade , who tallied 27 points , seven rebounds , four assists and three steals in the victory . Hassan Whiteside also had a great game , as he collected 13 points , nine rebounds and eight blocks in the win . Those eight blocks add to his already league - leading total and he 's truly playing at a different level this season than years past . This is one of the best defenses in the NBA right now and they showed why on Saturday . Miami will look to keep up their strong defense against the surging New York Knicks on Monday .
The Golden State Warriors ( 20 ) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans ( 0 - 2 ) 97 - 87 on Monday at Oracle Arena in Oakland in game two of their first round matchup of the Western Conference playoffs . The Pelicans got off to a really quick start in this game , out - scoring the Warriors 28 - 17 in the first quarter , as both Anthony Davis and Eric Gordon finished the quarter in double figures . The Warriors then got a huge spark off the bench in the second quarter from Leandro Barbosa , who scored 10 of his 12 points during that span , helping get the Warriors to a three - point lead at the break . After a tight third quarter , the Warriors finally broke out in the fourth , as Klay Thompson got hot and scored 14 points in the final quarter to help push the Warriors to the 10 - point win and give them the two game advantage in the series . Including scoring 14 in the fourth quarter , Klay Thompson finished the game with a team - high of 26 points , as he shot 11 - for - 17 from the field and 3 - for - 9 from deep . With Curry playing so well early on , Thompson did n't have to do much in the first half , but he really turned it on near the end of the game with a clutch performance in front of an electrifying crowd at Oracle Arena . Curry , on the other hand , posted 22 points ( 9 - 21 FG , 3 - 9 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) , four rebounds and six assists over 37 minutes . He did n't score at all in the fourth quarter , but he did n't need to with Thompson 's emergence . Another player that came up huge for the Warriors was Draymond Green , who time after time made the big play to get the Warriors their momentum back . He notched a double - double and did a little bit of everything in the win , finishing with 14 points ( 4 - 12 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , 12 rebounds , five assists , two steals and two blocked shots . Andrew Bogut chipped in with 14 rebounds as well , helping give the Warriors a 49 - 42 rebounding advantage . Along with helping the Pelicans get the strong start , both Davis and Gordon ended up as the team leaders in scoring . Davis recorded 26 points ( 9 - 22 FG , 8 - 8 FT ) , 10 rebounds and two blocked shots , while Gordon added 23 points ( 9 - 19 FG , 5 - 10 3Pt ) and two assists . Davis was having his way with the Warriors ' frontcourt early , but they stepped it up in the second half and held him in check . After feeling a pop in his left knee during game one of this series on Saturday , Tyreke Evans had to leave that game and he never returned . Evans was back in the lineup Monday though and the injury did n't look to hold him back , as he finished with 16 points ( 4 - 13 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 7 - 12 FT ) , 10 rebounds and seven assists in a near triple - double effort . If the Pelicans want to get over the hump and come out with a victory in this series , Evans will need to step it up even more in game three . Norris Cole provided a nice contribution off the bench as well , scoring 11 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 0 - 1 FT ) in 27 minutes . Cole was really the only bench production for the Pelicans though , as the Warriors ' bench was much more effective Monday . These two teams will now head to New Orleans to play game three of the series on Thursday .
The Thunder ( 18 - 19 ) held on to knock off the Jazz ( 13 - 24 ) behind 32 points from Kevin Durant on Friday . Oklahoma City trailed by as much as seven midway through the fourth quarter , but Durant and Westbrook stepped up down the stretch , scoring eight straight points in less than two minutes to put the Thunder up 92 - 90 with 2:54 to play . Following a Derrick Favors free throw , Westbrook fed Dion Waiters for a dunk to bring the Oklahoma City lead to three . Then , with the Thunder leading by one with 23 seconds to play , Durant found Waiters for a three - pointer that would prove to be the dagger . In his second game with the Thunder , Waiters finished with 15 points and four steals in 27 minutes off the bench . Westbrook had 25 points and 12 assists , and Durant poured in 32 points to go with six assists and five boards . Serge Ibaka was the only other Thunder player in double - figures , finishing with 12 points in 32 minutes . Utah was paced by 27 points from Gordon Hayward and 20 from Trey Burke . Favors added 22 points to go with 11 rebounds , and Trevor Booker chipped in eight points and nine rebounds off the bench . Rudy Gobert , who continues to start in place of the injured Enes Kanter , scored just four points but had seven rebounds and seven blocks . Gobert now has 25 blocks over his last five games . Up next , the Jazz continue their road swing in Houston on Saturday . Oklahoma City receives an extended break and will not play until Thursday , also in Houston .
These are two offenses that ca n't get anything going , so they decided to turn to their benches . In fact , Dallas had their bench score 44 points , while Orlando 's bench combined for 45 points of their own . The two leading scorers came off the bench too , as Jonathan Gibson dropped 26 points in his second game with the Mavs and D.J . Augustin scored 18 for the Magic . The backcourt of Wesley Matthews and Seth Curry scored 13 apiece , but they combined to go 8 - of - 23 from the field . Orlando 's stars were n't any better , as Nikola Vucevic and Evan Fournier combined to go 8 - of - 29 from the field . Amazingly , Dallas was 13 - of - 28 from three - point range , which was half of their makes for the evening ( 26 - of - 77 ) . Rebounding was the big difference in the game , with Orlando snatching down 50 boards to Dallas ' 34 .
The Washington Wizards ( 23 - 27 ) fought off a second - half rally from the New York Knicks ( 23 - 32 ) to win 111 - 108 at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday . Despite being outscored by 13 in the third quarter , Washington was able to narrowly pull out a win in the game 's final minutes . All-Star point guard John Wall not only led the Wizards in scoring with 28 , but dished out his second - highest assist total of the season with 17 . Wall played a whopping 43 minutes in four quarters and turned the ball over just once despite being the focal point of the Washington offense . Meanwhile , Wall 's backcourt partner in crime Bradley Beal drilled five three - pointers and poured in 26 points overall . Beal shot a disappointing 5 - for - 9 from the free - throw line , but more than made up for it with his impressive shooting from the field ( 8 - of - 14 ) and his stellar defense ( four steals ) . Overall , Washington won with a lights - out shooting performance from beyond the arc , as the team shot 16 - for - 26 from deep . Rebounding , however , proved to be an issue for the Wizards , as they pulled down just 32 boards to New York 's 46 . Superstar Carmelo Anthony was unsurprisingly the leader for his team on Tuesday , as he posted a game - high 33 points to go along with 13 rebounds . Melo hit three three - pointers and was perfect from the line , helping his team post an impressive 53 percent from the field . Anthony saw help in the form of Latvian rookie Kristaps Porzingis , who scored 20 points and blocked three shots . The Knicks struggled , however , to match their opponents ' heat from beyond the arc , as they shot just 31 percent from three - point territory . The Wizards will see their last contest before the All-Star break on Thursday as they visit Milwaukee . The Knicks , meanwhile , are done until after the break . They resume action in Brooklyn on Feb. 19 .
The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder , 107 - 91 , at Quicken Loans Arena on Sunday . The Cavaliers ( 32 - 14 ) came in to Sunday 's contest badly in need for a convincing victory against a quality opponent , as they 'd lost six of their last nine games , and had struggled to put away a significantly short - handed Brooklyn Nets squad until the fourth quarter on Friday . Things did n't seem to exactly be pointing in the right direction early on Sunday , as Kevin Love was forced from the game after 12 minutes with back spasms . The Thunder ( 28 - 20 ) also held a 24 - 21 lead after one quarter , but LeBron James and Kyrie Irving turned things up a notch during the second period . Cleveland outscore OKC by a 37 - 21 margin over that span , building 58 - 45 lead heading into halftime . Tristan Thompson and Iman Shumpert also turned in outstanding supporting efforts in the win , and the Cavs managed to hold their visitors to 37 percent shooting from the field , and a 23 percent success rate from three - point range . Russell Westbrook did manage to record yet another triple - double , but was `` contained ' to a manageable 20 points , 12 rebounds , 10 assists , one steal and one block , shooting just 7 - of - 26 from the field . Victor Oladipo did n't fare much better , posting 17 points ( on 6 - of - 18 shooting ) , seven boards and four assists . Domantas Sabonis provided 12 points and five rebounds . Steven Adams tallied seven points but also hauled in 10 boards , along with one assist and one block . Joffrey Lauvergne led the bench with 13 points , six rebounds and one assist . Irving paced Cleveland with 29 points , 10 assists , three rebounds and one steal . James supplied 25 points , 14 boards , eight assists and one steal . Thompson contributed a 19 - point , 12 - rebound double - double that also included one assist , four steals and four blocks . Reggie Jefferson led the second unit with eight points , four rebounds and one steal . The Thunder have another tough matchup on tap , as they now head to San Antonio to tangle with the Spurs on Tuesday evening . Meanwhile , the Cavs head to Dallas to face off with the Mavericks on Monday night .
The Toronto Raptors ( 20 ) were able to pull away on the road from the Boston Celtics ( 1 - 1 ) in the second half of Friday’s game , winning by a score of 113 - 103 . The two teams were dead even through the first two quarters , as the score was tied 26 - 26 after the first 12 minutes and 54 - 54 at halftime . However , the Raptors eventually used an 80 run in the third quarter to gain separation from the opposition , and maintained that advantage over the final 15 minutes . Terrence Ross was a star performer off the bench for Toronto , notching 21 points on 8 - for - 12 shooting . DeMarre Carroll knocked down four three - pointers to finish with 21 points , while Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan both shook off poor shooting nights to combine for 37 points . The Celtics were undone by the lack of scoring from their starting unit , as only two of the five starters reached double figures in scoring . That offensive deficiency was further exacerbated by the team’s ineffectiveness on the glass , with Toronto outrebounding Boston by a 53 - 38 count . For the second straight game , the Celtics leaned on Isaiah Thomas to drive the offense , and the guard didn’t disappoint with a team - leading 25 points and seven assists . Amir Johnson chipped in 11 points and eight boards off the bench , while fellow frontcourt reserve Kelly Olynyk contributed 11 points of his own . Toronto’s next game will come at home Sunday versus Milwaukee , while Boston will enjoy another home date that same day against San Antonio .
The Miami Heat defeated the visiting Toronto Raptors , 104 - 89 , at American Airlines Arena on Saturday evening . The Raptors ( 38 - 28 ) came out flat on the second night of a back - to - back , resulting in their second straight loss . They shot 38 percent from the field and only 2 - of - 15 from long range . The Heat ( 32 - 34 ) on the other hand , came out on fire , with a 32 - point first quarter and won the second quarter 27 - 15 , to take a 59 - 41 lead into halftime . Miami then held on through the second half to earn their fourth straight win and come one step closer to a spot in the top eight in the East . Dion Waiters was the high - point man for Miami , with 20 points on 6 - of - 10 shooting , including 4 - of - 6 from deep . Five other players scored in double digits for the Heat , including Goran Dragic , who chipped in 15 . Dragic had his night cut short after 17 minutes of action , as he took a hit in the eye , which resulted in swelling . Hassan Whiteside double - doubled , with 12 points and 14 rebounds , to go along with four blocks , in 33 minutes , while Tyler Johnson added 16 points on 6 - of - 12 shooting , in 27 minutes off the bench . The Heat will look to keep rolling , as they face the second game of a back - to - back in Indiana on Sunday . Meanwhile , despite shooting 5 - of - 16 , DeMar DeRozan was the high point man for the Raptors , with 17 points in 28 minutes of action . Norman Powell got the start in place of DeMarre Carroll and finished with 14 points on 5 - of - 14 shooting . Jonas Valanciunas finished with 10 points on 5 - of - 6 shooting , and 10 rebounds , in only 21 minutes . The Raptors will look to bounce back and avoid a third straight loss , as they play host the Mavericks on Monday .
Over the last five games , 76ers star Joel Embiid has been absent due to a knee contusion , and that opened the door for backup center and former No . 3 overall draft pick Jahlil Okafor to prove his worth to the organization - - or other organizations for that matter . Okafor has played in four of those five games , as he sat out for precautionary reasons in one , and in those four games , he 's given mixed results . While offensively Okafor has been somewhat productive in averaging 14 points per game following his 16 - point performance Monday , he has n't done so at a very efficient rate . Okafor has failed to shoot over 50 percent in three of those four games , and considering how he does the majority of his work near the basket , shooting 46 percent overall in that stretch is not a very impressive mark .
Kyrie Irving 's red - hot start continued Tuesday , with his 10 - for - 19 shooting tally from the field and 4 - for - 6 mark from beyond the arc leading the Cavs to record 52 and 50 percent success rates from the field and three - point range , respectively . Cleveland was markedly more efficient than the Rockets from the charity stripe , successfully converting 84 of their 31 free - throw attempts . They out - rebounded the Rockets by a 46 - 32 margin as well , in large part due to James and Tristan Thompson combining for half of that tally . The Rockets continue to lean heavily on Harden , who once again paced the team with 41 points while setting up another 30 - plus through his 15 assists . The remainder of the starting five outside of Eric Gordon continues to struggle to muster consistent offense , however , and went a combined 11 - for - 28 from the field .
The Minnesota Timberwolves ( 20 ) defeated the Denver Nuggets ( 1 - 1 ) 95 - 78 Friday . 2015 top overall pick Karl-Anthony Towns’ coming out party spearheaded the Timberwolves to a rousing victory over one of the more potent offenses in the NBA . The standout rookie posted his second double - double in as many games and was dominant on the defensive glass in particular , hauling in 11 of his 14 boards on that end of the floor . Towns’ deft 59 percent shooting ( 17 - for - 29 ) over his first two career games has also been an eye - opener . The Wolves also enjoyed a nice rebound effort from Andrew Wiggins , who had struggled mightily with his shot in the opener . Wiggins poured in 18 points to supplement Towns’ outstanding effort , and Zach LaVine and Kevin Martin paced Minnesota’s bench with 10 and 14 points , respectively . The Nuggets could not come close to duplicating their shocking road victory over the Rockets in the opener , enduring mediocre shooting nights from their starting five . First-round pick Emmanuel Mudiay paced Denver with 15 points and did cut down his turnovers to a respectable four after being charged with 11 in the opener . However , reserve Will Barton outscored the rest of the Nuggets’ starters with 14 points over 30 minutes , while the normally prolific Danilo Gallinari could only contribute 10 points on a subpar 4 - of - 13 shooting performance . Overall , Denver was only able to muster a mediocre 31 team field goal percentage in the loss . The victory keeps the Timberwolves perfect at 20 and in first place in the Western Conference’s Northwest Division . They now head to Portland to face the Blazers on Monday . The loss drops the Nuggets to 1 - 1 and places them into a last place tie in the Western Conference’s Northwest Division . They next head to Oklahoma City for a showdown with the Thunder on Sunday .
The Memphis Grizzlies ( 50 - 21 ) defeated the New York Knicks ( 14 - 57 ) 103 - 82 on Monday at Madison Square Garden in New York . While the Knicks have already been eliminated from playoff contention , the Grizzlies continue to sit comfortable in the top half of the Western Conference standings . They currently remain two and a half games above the Houston Rockets for the second seed in the West , but also trail the Golden State Warriors by seven games for the top overall seed . The Grizzlies were the much better shooting team in this game , going 52 percent from the field and an impressive 58 percent from the three - point line , while the Knicks ended at just 42 percent from the floor and a meager 22 percent from deep . The Grizzlies ' starting frontcourt came up big again Monday , as they combined to score 56 of the 103 total points . Zach Randolph led the way , finishing with a team - high of 23 points ( 9 - 12 FG , 5 - 6 FT ) , to go along with seven rebounds and five assists . He 's played well of late for Memphis and is averaging 19 points and 7 rebounds over his last five games . Marc Gasol also had a strong showing , posting 21 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 3 - 5 FT ) and eight rebounds over 32 minutes . Gasol shot just 27 percent ( 4 - 15 FG ) from the field during Saturday 's game against the Portland Trail Blazers , so it was good to see him have a lot more success on Monday . Jeff Green chipped in with 12 points ( 4 - 9 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) and three rebounds as well . It was Vince Carter and Kosta Koufos who provided a nice push off the bench . Carter finished with 14 points ( 4 - 8 FG , 4 - 6 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) in 21 minutes , while Koufos recorded 10 points ( 5 - 7 FG ) and five rebounds in 16 minutes . Langston Galloway did his best to keep the Knicks in this game , going 7 - for - 16 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 19 points , while also adding seven rebounds and five assists . He had combined to go 5 - for - 22 from the floor and just 1 - for - 7 from deep over his last two games , so it was a breath of fresh air for Knicks ' fans seeing Galloway shoot a little better Monday . Andrea Bargnani did his part as well , posting 18 points ( 8 - 18 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) and two blocked shots in 31 minutes . He 's been one of the more consistent players for this team , averaging 17 points , 4 rebounds and one blocked shot during his last 10 games . With Alexey Shved sidelined with a rib injury , Shane Larkin moved into the starting lineup , but he contributed just four points ( 2 - 7 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt ) and seven assists in 43 minutes . Lance Thomas chipped in with 15 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and two steals , while Jason Smith came off the bench for 16 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) and four rebounds . The Grizzlies ' next game will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday , while the Knicks will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday .
While the 76ers won and ended their eight - game losing streak , they by no means put together a perfect performance . In fact , the game 's result simply came down to the fact that even in spots where Philadelphia struggled , the Pelicans somehow found a way to be worse . The 76ers shot a fairly poor 43 percent overall from the field , while the Pelicans managed to shoot just 39 percent . Philadelphia struggled to make it to the free throw line , shooting just 13 attempts and only making nine of them ( 69 percent ) . And while New Orleans did get to the line more often , shooting 25 shots from the charity stripe , they made just 68 percent of those . Where the Pelicans excelled was in taking care of the basketball , committing just 12 turnovers on the night , but the 76ers still found a way to be better there , committing just 10 turnovers .
The host Utah Jazz beat the visiting Los Angeles Lakers on Friday , 96 - 89 . It was the season debut for banged - up Jazz star Derrick Favors . Favors missed the majority of the preseason and the team 's season opener with a bruised knee , but was able to transition back into a limited role for Friday 's contest . The forward came off the bench for an impressive 15 points and nine rebounds in 20 minutes , but showed some signs of rust , turning the ball over five times . His typical frontcourt partner , French seven - footer Rudy Gobert , made a major impact on the defensive end with four blocks . Gobert 's six offensive rebounds also helped the Jazz overcome a poor perimeter shooting night , offering Utah a number of second - chance attempts . The Lakers , meanwhile , received troubling news , as rookie Brandon Ingram was forced to leave the game with a knee injury after just four minutes of play . Though not appearing to be serious , the second overall pick will likely be monitored closely going forward . It was a tough night for young Lakers in general , as guard D'Angelo Russell went just 3 - for - 14 from the field , while forward Julius Randle scored just seven points and recorded only four rebounds . The Lakers did manage to find a scoring boost off the bench , as sixth man Lou Williams led the team with 17 . Both teams will travel on Sunday , with the Jazz visiting the Los Angeles Clippers and the Lakers taking on the Thunder in Oklahoma City .
The Sacramento Kings ( 11 - 10 ) defeated the Utah Jazz ( 5 - 16 ) 101 - 92 on Monday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento . Despite only having five victories on the year , the Jazz put up a fight and kept even with the Kings all the way up until the start of the fourth quarter . The Kings were able to use a significant rebounding advantage and superior shooting to out - score the Jazz 33 - 24 in the final quarter , thus sealing the nine - point victory at home . With DeMarcus Cousins still sitting out with an illness , Rudy Gay continued to take the lead for the Kings . He shot 10 - for - 19 from the field and 0 - for - 1 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 29 points . He also got to the free throw line 10 times , and was able to convert on nine of those attempts , pushing his season scoring average to 21 points per game . Darren Collison was an important piece in the victory . He scored 16 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) and handed out six assists in 32 minutes , as he also was continued to be relied upon to make up for the loss of Cousins . Nik Stauskas had arguably his best game of the season , as he recorded a season - high of 15 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) and eight rebounds in 30 minutes off the bench . The Jazz failed to receive very much production from their bench , therefore putting it on the shoulders of their starters . Gordon Hayward led the team with 19 points ( 6 - 16 FG , 1 - 7 3Pt , 6 - 10 FT ) and seven assists , while also matching a season - high with four steals . He struggled against the Magic on Friday , so it was a nice bounce back game for him . Alec Burks chipped in 16 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 6 - 9 FT ) of his own , as he 's put together a couple of solid games in a row . He 's combined for 38 points , 12 rebounds and six assists in the previous two games , giving the Jazz a little bit of everything . Both Enes Kanter and Trey Burke finished with 13 points , but it was n't enough to propel the Jazz past the Kings .

The Denver Nuggets ( 24 - 37 ) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers ( 12 - 50 ) 117 - 107 at Pepsi Center on Wednesday . The second game of a back - to - back for the Lakers proved to be a heavy workload , as the team looked tired throughout the second half .

Bass added 11 points on 4 - of - 7 shooting off the bench , but helped bring his team within striking distance of the Nuggets down the stretch , forcing a couple of turnovers and defending both the paint and wing at an exceptional level . Bryant five points in 10 minutes of game time , while Julius Randle fell short of a double - double with 17 points and seven rebounds . The Lakers will host the Atlanta Hawks ( 33 - 28 ) on Friday . The Nuggets held on to win , but it looked bleak after surviving an eight minutes stretch of play between the third and fourth quarters where they scored an underwhelming two points . Denver shot 1 - of - 12 during that stretch , and save for the Lakers inability to rebound the ball , the eight minute stretch could have been extended . The unlikely hero came on the back of D.J . Augustin , who rallied the Nuggets after the scoring drought and finished with 26 points , seven rebounds , five assists and one steal on 7 - of - 11 shooting in 23 minutes off of the bench . Emmanuel Mudiay put together a strong game , and the rookie matchup with Russell made for the most entertainment , as he rounded out the box score with 22 points , four rebounds and seven assists on 10 - of - 20 shooting . Gary Harris , Nikola Jokic and Kenneth Faried all finished in double figures in their starting roles . The Nuggets will host the Brooklyn Nets ( 17 - 44 ) on Friday .

Throughout a difficult start to the season that has included multi - game injuries to starters Chris Paul and J.J. Redick , the Clippers have been able to lean on Blake Griffin as a dependable source of outstanding production . Sunday , even Griffin succumbed to the malaise that currently seems to surround Los Angeles , mustering a season - low nine points , along with six rebounds , four assists and a pair of steals . He also turned the ball over a season - high six times in a forgettable performance versus a Raptors defense that had been vulernable to opposing power forwards coming into the game . Toronto enjoyed impressive contributions from every starter , with DeMarre Carroll and DeMar DeRozan leading the way with a pair of 21 - point efforts . Kyle Lowry pitched in with his second double - double of the season ( 13 points , 10 assists ) , while veteran power forward Luis Scola continued a resurgent age - 35 season with 20 points and eight rebounds .

It was his highest scoring output of the season after only reaching double digits once this season before Wednesday .

Nets center Brook Lopez finished with game highs in points ( 24 ) and rebounds ( 15 ) as he earned his third consecutive double - double .

They continue their road trip with a lighter meal against the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday . Toronto had their six - game win streak snapped with this loss , but more devestating was that DeMar DeRozan had to leave the game with a left groin strain after 20 minutes of action , and his status going forward is unclear . Louis Williams and Greivis Vasquez picked up the backcourt slack with DeRozan out . Williams scored 16 points in 30 minutes off the bench , while Vasquez put up 14 points and six assists in 25 minutes off the bench .

He went 12 - for - 22 from the field and 5 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score 31 points , while adding three assists in 38 minutes . He had a brutal showing against the Golden State Warriors on Friday , where he shot just 14 percent ( 2 - for - 14 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt ) from the field , so it was good to see him get back on track Sunday . Dirk Nowitzki finished with 12 points ( 5 - 12 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt ) and four rebounds in 26 minutes . He has n't been scoring much lately , as he 's averaging just 13 points over his last four games , which is far less than his season average of 17 points per game . Also scoring less than his season scoring average was Chandler Parsons , who recorded just 11 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 0 - 1 FT ) and six rebounds . Like Nowitzki , he 's been playing poorly offensively of late and is averaging just 10 points over his last four games .

It was his second strong showing in a row , as he 's coming off a 25 - point , six - assist performance Friday . Over those two games , he 's shot a combined 18 - for - 31 from the field , as he looks to be dialed in and more confident than he 's been all season long . Also doing his best to help the Lakers stay in the game was Carlos Boozer , who came off the bench for a team - high of 17 points ( 8 - 15 FG , 1 - 1 FT ) , to go along with eight rebounds in 25 minutes . Over his last four games , he 's averaging 13 points and 8 rebounds as he continues to be the veteran leader of this team . Wesley Johnson shot well , going 6 - for - 9 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score 15 points . He 's combined for 29 points and nine rebounds over his last two games . Wayne Ellington chipped in with 13 points ( 6 - 16 FG , 1 - 7 3Pt ) and five rebounds as well . The Mavericks ' next game will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday , while the Lakers will be at home against the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday .
The San Antonio Spurs ( 5 - 3 ) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers ( 1 - 8 ) 93 - 80 on Friday . San Antonio has won three straight games .

The New York Knicks ( 4 - 10 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 0 - 13 ) 91 - 83 on Friday .

The Knicks will begin a three - game road trip in Houston on Monday against the Rockets .

The Indiana Pacers ( 5 - 4 ) defeated the Boston Celtics ( 3 - 4 ) 102 - 91 on Wednesday at the TD Garden in Boston . In a relatively sloppy game with 37 combined turnovers , it was the Pacers who were able to come into Boston and steal an 11 - point victory . They were the superior shooters as a team , going 48 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three - point line , while the Celtics shot just 41 percent from the field and a paltry 17 percent from beyond the arc . With the higher shooting percentages , as well as a 41 - 36 rebounding advantage , the Pacers were able to seal the win . Paul George 's re - emergence this season coninued Wednesday with a 26 - point ( 10 - 22 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) , 10 - rebound performance . George sat out all but six games last season with a broken leg , but is now putting up career numbers to start the year , averaging 24 points , 9 rebounds , 5 assists and 2 steals over 36 minutes per game . The double - double also marked his fifth on the young season already , so George is showing some serious production . C.J . Miles saw extended time with Rodney Stuckey out due to an ankle injury . He took advantage of the extra minutes , scoring 17 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , to go along with five rebounds and two steals . In injury related news , the Pacers did see one of their top young prospects leave the game . Rookie Myles Turner suffered a sprained thumb in the first quarter and was forced to sit out the rest of the game . Marcus Smart made his much anticipated return to the court after sitting out the last three games due to a toe injury . Coach Brad Stevens had him come off the bench , where he struggled to just eight points ( 1 - 6 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 6 - 8 FT ) and two assists over 21 minutes . Considering Avery Bradley was sidelined with a leg injury as well , Isaiah Thomas and Evan Turner were the make - shift backcourt for the Celtics .

The Mavericks have remained solidly in the Western Conference playoff picture despite losing multiple starters to free agency this offseason . Dallas has been boosted by small forward Chandler Parsons ' return from injury . Parsons led the team with 19 points against Brooklyn while also pulling down 10 rebounds . Georgian center Zaza Pachulia , whose campaign for the NBA All-Star game nearly landed him a starting nod , also notched a double - double , recording 16 points and 12 rebounds . The Nets hold the third - worst record in the NBA , and do not hold their own draft pick next year ( Boston received Brooklyn 's unprotected 2016 pick as part of a previous trade ) . Despite these negatives , the team has seen bright play from Brook Lopez and Thaddeus Young in the frontcourt . Lopez led the game with 28 points and grabbed 12 rebounds , while Young posted an 11 - point , 10 - rebound double - double while grabbing five steals . Brooklyn will travel to New Orleans on Saturday to take on the Pelicans . Meanwhile , Dallas will play host to Phoenix on Sunday .
The Sacramento Kings ( 10 - 15 ) defeated the Houston Rockets ( 12 - 14 ) 107 - 97 in a sloppy game on Tuesday . In a battle of two of the worst defenses in the NBA , the offenses played poorly . It 's not like the defenses played well either , as Houston shot just 41 percent from the field . Sacramento did shoot 51 percent , but committed an ugly 28 turnovers in the win . There were a combined 30 steals and 49 turnovers in the game and those are not far off from NBA records . The Rockets came into this game in the second half of a back - to - back and they played tired . There were numerous possessions where players were standing around and way too many defensive lapses when there was simply no defense being played at all . The team was outrebounded 47 to 36 and shot just 31 percent from three - point range . Those are indications of a tired team , but the effort simply wasn’t there . James Harden was spectacular yet again though , as he tallied 33 points , seven rebounds and six assists in the defeat . Houston will have a good opportunity to bounce back when they take on the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday in their next game . It 's not too often a team commits 28 turnovers and wins , but the Kings managed to pull that off somehow on Tuesday . They played without Rajon Rondo , but all the other starters filled - in nicely in his absence . Darren Collison was the starting point guard for this game and played extremely well , accumulating 14 points , 13 assists and seven rebounds in the win . DeMarcus Cousins also stepped up in Rondo 's absence , totaling 26 points and 12 rebounds . Rudy Gay and Omri Casspi also chipped in for some great games , as they combined for 36 points , 19 rebounds , nine assists and eight steals in the victory . This was a great team performance from Sacramento and it 's nice to see everyone chipping in without Rondo in the lineup . The Kings have a few days off until their next game , when they take on the struggling Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday .
The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 14 - 9 ) defeated the Charlotte Hornets ( 6 - 18 ) 97 - 88 on Monday . Cleveland ended their two - game losing streak with the win .

Charlotte got off to a horrible start in the first quarter , beginning the game on an 0 - 21 stretch in which the Hornets allowed 21 points to the Cavaliers , while scoring none of their own . Michael Kidd-Gilchrist reclaimed his spot as the starting small forward , pushing Gerald Henderson back to a bench role and Lance Stephenson back to shooting guard . Kemba Walker led the fight back for the Hornets , finishing with a team - high 24 points , but it was the play of Charlotte 's bench that allowed them to end the game respectably . The Cavaliers will host the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday , while the Hornets will also play Wednesday , hosting the Phoenix Suns .
The Spurs saw a solid set of stat lines en route to a win over the Clippers on Friday . Superstar forward Kawhi Leonard led the team with 21 points on 7 - of - 16 shooting .

Darren Collison produced nine points , but Ben McLemore and Kosta Koufos could only supply a combined 10 points . Embiid 's 25 points paced the Sixers . Sergio Rodriguez followed with 18 points , but the remaining three members of the first unit failed to hit double digits in the scoring column , as Jahlil Okafor ( six points ) , Gerald Henderson ( six points ) and Robert Covington ( five points ) under - performed on the scoreboard . However , Ersan Ilyasova and Dario Saric provided bench scoring with respective tallies of 17 and 12 points .
The Toronto Raptors ( 20 - 13 ) defeated the Washington Wizards ( 14 - 16 ) 94 - 91 on Wednesday . The Wizards have considerably struggled throughout the season defending opposing shooting guards . This surprisingly held true when Bradley Beal , who has a good reputation on the defensive side of the ball , was healthy , and has persisted while he 's been sidelined over the last two - plus weeks with a lower leg problem . The deficiency reared its ugly head again Wednesday against one of the top two - guards in the NBA . DeMar DeRozan led all scorers with 34 points , and added six rebounds , five assists , two steals and two blocks . He drained 17 of those in the first half , a total that partially consisted of a perfect 8 - for - 8 performance at the free - throw line . He preserved the pristine effort from the charity stripe in the second half , finishing 15 - for - 15 for the game . The visitors were led by Otto Porter , Jr. , who tallied 20 points , nine rebounds and a pair of assists , his second straight 20 - point - plus outing . John Wall followed with yet another double - double , managing 19 points and adding 11 assists . He also produced seven rebounds , five steals and a block in a terrific all - around effort . It was Wall 's seventh straight double - double , as he continued his stellar play during Beal 's extended absence . Jared Dudley ( 17 points ) and Marcin Gortat ( 12 points , nine rebounds ) also made solid contributions , while Ramon Sessions was highly efficient in pacing the Wizards bench with 11 points , seven rebounds and four assists . The Wizards dropped to 14 - 16 and remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They will head home to face the Orlando Magic on New Year 's Day . With respect to the Raptors starters , it was essentially DeRozan and not a whole lot else . Kyle Lowry ( 11 point , six assists , three rebounds , two steals ) was the only other front - line player that amassed double - digit scoring , while Terrence Ross and Bismack Biyombo were both outstanding off the bench . Ross collected 14 points and six rebounds while Biyombo produced a double - double in his first game back in a reserve role , tallying 12 points and hauling in 12 boards . The man that he 'd been replacing while he healed from a broken hand , Jonas Valanciunas , posted eight points and nine rebounds . The Raptors improved to 20 - 13 and continue atop the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They remain home for a New Year 's Day showdown against the Charlotte Hornets .
The Washington Wizards defeated the Charlotte Hornets , 109 - 106 , at Verizon Center on Wednesday . The back - and - forth tussle between two relatively evenly - matched teams was undecided until the closing seconds , as both teams made respective strong pushes in the second half . The Hornets ( 14 - 12 ) had built a 54 - 49 lead by halftime , but the Wizards ( 10 - 14 ) stormed back in the third , winning the period by a 38 - 23 margin . Charlotte had their own resurgence in the final quarter , outscoring their hosts by 29 - 22 but still falling short , with a John Wall free throw in the waning seconds providing the final margin of victory .

The Sacramento Kings ( 28 - 53 ) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers ( 21 - 60 ) 102 - 92 on Monday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento . With both teams already eliminated from the playoffs , this game was more about getting a look at players in anticipation of next season . It also cemented the Lakers with the fourth worst record in the league , meaning they 'll have the fourth best odds to win the first overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft . The Kings won this game in the fourth quarter , where they went on a huge run to out - score the Lakers 27 - 18 . The Kings also secured the shooting advantage , finishing at 49 percent from the field , while the Lakers ended at 42 percent .

He went off for a game - high of 26 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 10 - 13 FT ) , while nearly notching a triple - double with nine rebounds and six assists as well . Over his last five games , he 's averaging an impressive 22 points , 6 rebounds and 4 assists . Coming off the bench , Derrick Williams had a strong showing as well . He went 6 - for - 12 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 20 points over 29 minutes . Like Casspi , he 's been relied upon to pick up the slack without Cousins and Gay , as he 's averaged 16 points over his last five games . Jason Thompson came up with a 10 - point ( 4 - 8 FG , 2 - 4 FT ) , 10 - rebound double - double , while also recording three blocked shots . It marked the third time over his last four games reaching double - digit rebounds . Both Carl Landry and Ray McCallum reached double figures as well . Landry had 14 points ( 5 - 7 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) and three rebounds over 19 minutes , while McCallum added 12 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and five rebounds over 28 minutes . Rookie Jordan Clarkson was again one of the few Lakers to have some success . He went 10 - for - 21 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 23 points , to go along with five rebounds , six assists and five steals . Clarkson has already earned himself a role for this team next year , but he continues to improve his numbers late in the season , averaging 22 points and 7 assists over his last five games . Jabari Brown also played well in the loss , finishing with 18 points ( 6 - 17 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 5 - 6 FT ) and seven assists over 46 minutes .

The only other Laker in double figures was Jordan Hill . Hill posted 18 points ( 9 - 19 FG ) of his own , while adding six rebounds and four assists .

These two teams will play each other again on Wednesday in each team 's final game of the season .
The Chicago Bulls defeated the Detroit Pistons , 117 - 95 , at United Center on Wednesday night . The Bulls ( 34 - 38 ) came into Wednesday 's contest missing big man Robin Lopez , who 'd been suspended for his part in a fight with the Raptors ' Serge Ibaka on Tuesday evening . His absence was potentially hurtful , as Lopez had been playing a much larger role in the offense following Dwyane Wade 's season - ending elbow injury . However , Joffrey Lauvergne , who 'd shown flashes of offensive prowess during his limited opportunities in Denver and Oklahoma City , stepped up in his spot start to post 17 points , seven rebounds , three assists and one steal . Meanwhile , Nikola Mirotic made the most of his starting role as well , as he tallied a game - high 28 points to go along with five boards , two assists , three steals and one block .

Serge Ibaka was the story coming into Sunday 's matchup and he did n't disappoint . Not only did he score a career - high 31 points , he hit a game - winning jumper with just 0 seconds left . He was n't the only one in a revenge game though , as Victor Oladipo scored 12 points against his former team . Russell Westbrook added to his absurd averages , as he tallied 41 points , 12 rebounds and 16 assists in the defeat . This game was full of swings , as the Magic led by 21 in the first half , before the Thunder went on a 17 - 2 run in the third quarter to take a brief lead . While Oklahoma City did shoot over 50 percent from the field , they really struggled with threes and free - throws . In fact , they shot just 28 percent from three - point range and 61 percent from the free - throw line . There were 116 combined points in the paint , as defense became an optional facet of this game .
The host Minnesota Timberwolves took down the Phoenix Suns on Monday , 115 - 108 . Minnesota ( 8 - 19 ) has had a disappointing start to the season but received a confidence boost with a strong win on Monday .

The Wolves ' other two young studs , Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine , also turned out impressive performances . Wiggins delivered 26 points , while LaVine dropped 23 including four three - pointers .

The Miami Heat ( 7 - 4 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 4 - 9 ) 116 - 109 on Thursday . The Kings found out earlier in the afternoon that they 'd lost starting power forward DeMarcus Cousins for the night , due to a suspension stemming from his forearm shot on Al Horford in Wednesday night 's contest versus the Hawks . The ripple effect of his absence brought Kosta Koufos and Omri Casspi into the starting lineup for Sacramento , which could have used their All-Star big man , particularly during a valiant effort to close their deficit in the second half . Although they found themselves in a 56 - 46 hole at the half , the Kings did finish with a healthy total of 109 points due to a number of valuable contributions across the lineup . Rajon Rondo held up his end of the bargain trying to keep the Kings offense running on all cylinders , coming within a rebound of a second consecutive triple - double and fourth in five games . The veteran point guard poured in 14 points and 18 assists , while hauling in nine boards for good measure . Rudy Gay supported Rondo 's effort with a double - double performance of his own , posting 13 points , 12 rebounds , a pair of assists , and a steal . Meanwhile , Casspi played a season - high 39 minutes and was productive with the extended court time , chipping in with a 16 - point , six - rebound effort . Ben McLemore continued to show signs of offensive life after a rough start to the season , amassing double - digit points ( 17 ) for the second consecutive night . Notably , Marco Belinelli contributed a season - high 23 points off the bench in a highly efficient 26 minutes . The Kings fell to 4 - 9 and currently reside in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They next head to Orlando for a date with the Magic on Saturday . The Heat benefited from strong bounce - back efforts from their two veteran stars , Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade . The All-Stars had each suffered through middling performances versus the Timberwolves on Tuesday , but took advantage of their respective favorable matchups against Sacramento . Free of having to bump bodies with Cousins all night , Bosh posted 23 points , 11 rebounds , four assists and a block in one of his most complete performances of the year . Wade stuffed the stat sheet as well , amassing 24 points , six assists , five rebounds and a pair of steals against the Kings ' vulnerable shooting guard defense .

The Raptors avoided a second collapse against the Timberwolves this season by clamping down in the fourth quarter .

The Raptors led by as many as nine in the fourth quarter before Minnesota tied it up at 101 with 3:48 to go .

Lowry really helped Toronto get over the hump in this one as he scored 12 of his 21 points ( 6 - 14 FG , 3 - 8 3Pt , 6 - 6 FT ) in the final quarter .

The Portland Trail Blazers ( 35 - 32 ) defeated the Orlando Magic ( 28 - 37 ) 121 - 84 at Moda Center on Saturday . The Blazers won by the definition of team effort and the scoring outburst from their bench . Granted , the Magic were thin in terms of talent , as Elfrid Payton ( elbow ) , Brandon Jennings ( achilles ) and Nikola Vucevic ( groin ) were all out for the game . Portland dominated every quarter of play and went into the half with a 21 point lead , and the efficient shooting as a whole kept Orlando out of striking distance throughout the final two quarters . The Blazers were led by Damian Lillard , who fell below scoring average , which is good for fifth in the league this year , but still turned in 19 points , 10 assists and four rebounds on 6 - of - 11 shooting .

The Washington Wizards defeated the Charlotte Hornets , 109 - 99 , at Spectrum Center on Monday night . The Wizards ( 24 - 20 ) could hardly have been blamed for potentially coming in to Monday with a bit of a hangover from their last game , a heartbreaking 113 - 112 loss to the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night . Washington saw a 112 - 111 lead go by the wayside at the buzzer courtesy of a Marcus Morris tip - in , and they were facing another formidable challenge in the form of a surging Hornets ( 23 - 22 ) squad that had won three in a row . However , the Wizards were up to the task , jumping on their hosts from the opening quarter and never letting up . Washington played very well on both sides of the ball , tallying 54 and 40 percent success rates from the field and three - point range , respectively , and also limiting Charlotte to 39 and 25 percent figures in those categories . John Wall and Markieff Morris led the way by combining for 47 points and 52 percent shooting . Wall 's 24 points paced the Wizards , and he added seven assists , four rebounds and a steal . Morris followed with 23 points , a total he supplemented with eight rebounds and two assists . Bradley Beal was a highly effective third wheel with 18 points , five rebounds , four assists and a steal . Otto Porter , Jr. contributed a 14 - point , 13 - rebound double - double that also included two assists . Marcin Gortat put forward a modest eight points and seven boards , along with an assist , a steal and a block .

Michael Kidd-Gilchrist totaled eight points , seven boards , an assist and a block , and Nicolas Batum had a relatively quiet game by his standards , especially on the scoreboard , posting four points , six assists and seven rebounds . The Wizards head back home to face off with the Boston Celtics on Tuesday evening , while the Hornets remain home to face off with the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night .
It was one of the best nights of the season for Washington , as the Wizards blew out their divisional rival by almost 30 points . Rising star Otto Porter Jr. was at the forefront of the winning effort , leading the team with 21 points while pulling down 11 rebounds . Star point guard John Wall , meanwhile , scored 19 while dishing out a team - leading nine assists . Though the Wizards typically shoot few three - pointers , Friday was a different story . The team buried 13 - of - 31 three - point shots . Atlanta , meanwhile , had an abysmal night from the field . The Hawks shot just 36 percent and under 30 percent from three - point range . It may have been the worst night of the season for All-Star Paul Millsap , who shot just 1 - of - 7 for four points and four rebounds . Center Dwight Howard , however , had a double - double with 12 points and 13 boards .
The Raptors ( 14 - 9 ) squeezed out a 97 - 94 victory over the Spurs ( 18 - 5 ) at Air Canada Centre on Wednesday . The Raptors held a three - point lead into the final possession following a basket from Kawhi Leonard , but a huge offensive rebound by DeMar DeRozan after a Kyle Lowry miss helped give Toronto the win . The loss for San Antonio snapped a four - game win streak and Leonard , who was questionable to play due to an illness , finished with just nine points and seven rebounds . It was only a matter of time before the Spurs would crack and perhaps their downfall was due to no one truly stepping up and taking the reins . By the end of the game , 11 players had scored for San Antonio , but Manu Ginobili led the way with 17 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 6 - 8 FT ) over 25 minutes off the bench . Tim Duncan returned to the lineup after getting the night off Monday against the 76ers , scoring eight points in 20 minutes . The Spurs really struggled from beyond the arc , finishing 7 - of - 26 to a tune of 27 percent in the game . DeRozan not only sealed the win with a big board , but had one of his best offensive performances of the season , scoring a game - high 28 points ( 10 - 15 FG , 8 - 8 FT ) to go along with six assists and four rebounds in 37 minutes . He stuck to what has made him a successful scorer , taking high - percentage shots while working his way to the free throw line consistently . Playing with a short bench with DeMarre Carroll sidelined again , the Raptors got a big boost from Luis Scola , who finished with 16 points ( 8 - 14 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 0 - 1 FT ) while pulling down eight rebounds over 33 minutes . The Raptors continue their six - game homestand Friday against the Bucks ; the Spurs head back to San Antonio for a date with the Lakers .
The San Antonio Spurs ( 4 - 2 ) blew out the Charlotte Hornets ( 2 - 4 ) 114 - 94 on Saturday night . The Spurs were simply fantastic offensively in this matchup , as they shot over 50 percent from the field and accumulated 35 assists as a team . The third quarter was when the tide turned for both teams , as the Spurs scored 42 points in the quarter , which included an 180 run . This was an utter domination in nearly every statistic , as the Spurs had more rebounds , assists , steals , blocks and less turnovers than the Hornets in the win . Point guard Kemba Walker might have had his best game of the season on Saturday for Charlotte and it was all for nothing . He tallied 27 points , four assists and two steals on 11 - of - 15 shooting in under 30 minutes of action . The problem for the Hornets was that the only player who scored more than 13 points was Walker and that simply wo n't get it done against a team like the Spurs . They also shot below 65 percent from the free - throw line and all that makes for a recipe of disaster . Charlotte has a few days off until they play the Minnesota Timberwolves in a very winable game on Tuesday . The Spurs were at top form on Saturday , as they outscored the Hornets by 16 points in the second half . They played some typical Spurs basketball , as they dished out 35 team assists , while shooting 56 percent from the field . San Antonio was led by Kawhi Leonard who scored a team - high 23 points in the victory . The bench was spectacular as well , as they got 15 points from Patty Mills , 13 points from Manu Ginobili and a near triple - double from David West . The Spurs will look to carry this sparkling form into Monday 's matchup against a struggling Sacramento Kings team .
The Oklahoma City Thunder ( 23 - 22 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 7 - 37 ) 92 - 84 on Monday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City . Neither team shot very well in this matchup , but the Thunder still had the slight advantage , going 42 percent from the field and 20 percent from the three - point line , while the Timberwolves went just 34 percent from the floor and a meager 15 percent from beyond the arc . The Thunder were able to use a strong first half , out - scoring the Timberwolves 48 - 40 , giving them enough of an advantage to secure the victory in front of their home crowd . With Kevin Durant sitting out with a sprained toe , Russell Westbrook did most of the shooting Monday , going 7 - for - 22 from the field to score 18 points in 30 minutes . It may not have been his best performance shooting the ball , but it was still enough to push the Thunder to a victory . Westbrook is averaging 24 points over his last four games . Serge Ibaka had a strong showing as well , scoring 13 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt ) and grabbing a ridiculous 19 rebounds . The double - double was his third in a row , while the 19 rebounds were a new season - high . The Thunder got a lot of help from their bench though . Both Anthony Morrow ( 5 - 13 FG , 1 - 7 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) and Reggie Jackson ( 5 - 7 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) scored 14 points , while Dion Waiters added 10 ( 4 - 12 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 1 - 4 FT ) points . Thaddeus Young and Andrew Wiggins were the biggest reasons that the Timberwolves were able to stay competitive in this game . Young had 22 points ( 8 - 20 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 6 - 6 FT ) and eight rebounds , while Wiggins had 23 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 9 - 12 FT ) , four rebounds and two steals . Young has had an impressive couple of games in a row , combining for 48 points , 14 rebounds and 10 assists over that span . He 's starting to find his groove , after not living up to expectations so far this season . The only other Timberwolve 's player to reach double figures in points was Zach LaVine , who came off the bench for 11 points ( 3 - 9 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) and five rebounds . Gorgui Dieng did n't have his best showing offensively with only six points , but he was still an animal on the boards , recording 18 rebounds in 35 minutes . The Thunder 's next game will be on the road against the New York Knicks on Wednesday , while the Timberwolves will be at home against the Boston Celtics on Wednesday .
The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Phoenix Suns , 111 - 106 , at Smoothie King Center on Monday .

Anthony Davis once again carried the load , as he accumulated 34 points , nine rebounds , two steals and five blocks in the win . Jrue Holiday was just as good , collecting 30 points , nine rebounds , seven assists and three blocks . E'Twaun Moore was the next highest scorer , as he provided 12 points , four rebounds and four steals off the bench .
The Rockets have the league 's second highest - scoring offense , and showcased their ability to find the bucket on Monday . Six Rockets scored in double figures and the team shot 50 percent with 15 three - pointers en route to the blowout win .

The Celtics were expected to win this game easily , but the Knicks had other ideas . The rebounding differential was glaring to say the least , with New York winning that battle , 58 - 33 . The bench production was a huge part of that , with New York 's bench grabbing 33 rebounds , while Boston 's bench snatched down just eight boards . New York shot over 50 percent from the field , while Boston could n't crack 39 percent . Derrick Rose was at MVP form , as he accumulated 30 points , 10 rebounds , five assists , two steals and two blocks in the win .

Terrence Ross hit a free throw to close the gap to two , and Hassan Whiteside missed the first on the other end , leaving the Raptors with three seconds to find a three - pointer to tie the game .

The Golden State Warriors ( 25 - 1 ) took care of the Phoenix Suns ( 11 - 16 ) 128 - 103 on Wednesday to rebound after their first loss . The Warriors looked timid for the first 20 minutes of the game , but turned it on after that . They trailed for the majority of the first half , until Steph Curry caught fire and the team won the second quarter by 15 points . The most amazing stat is that the Warriors scored 79 points in the second and third quarters to run away with a dominant victory . Golden State shot an amazing 52 percent from the field and recorded 32 assists in the blowout victory . The Suns first meeting with the Warriors was a similar result and they simply ca n't stop this potent offense . Aside from Brandon Knight 's 17 points , the other four starters combined for just 19 points . The bench did play well though , as Mirza Teletovic provided 24 points and T.J. Warren scored 19 . The team has won just four games in their last 15 and the defense is really killing them right now . The Suns will look to play better in their next game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday . Steph Curry sat for the ninth time this season in the entirety of the fourth quarter and that stat alones tells the dominance of this team . Prior to sitting for the final 12 minutes , Curry tallied 25 points and seven assists . He wasn’t the hero tonight though , as Klay Thompson dropped 27 points in the third quarter en route to a 43 - point night . Draymond Green also provided yet another triple - double and it appears that one loss was a blip on the radar rather than a sign of future struggles . It 's scary to think what they 'll do to the Milwaukee Bucks in their next game on Friday , who ended their historic streak earlier in the week .

After allowing a massive 38 points in the first quarter , the New Orleans Pelicans ( 14 - 27 ) secured their third victory in four games with a 114 - 99 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 13 - 30 ) . Superstar Anthony Davis dropped in a game - high 35 points , helping propel the Pelicans to victory . Davis has flown under the radar in the Pelicans ' disappointing season , despite his impressive averages of 23 points , 11 rebounds , and 3 blocks per game . `` The Brow '' currently sits at fourth in the league in double - doubles this season , and has been a major part of New Orlean 's increasing success as of late . Point guard Jrue Holiday also exploded off the bench in the win over Minnesota , delivering 19 points and nine assists in 27 minutes of action . The former All-Star has averaged 18 points and 10 assists over his last three games while turning the ball over just four times in total . Minnesota 's season has deteriorated rapidly , as the team has now lost seven straight on the road .

The New York Knicks ( 30 - 43 ) took down the shorthanded Chicago Bulls ( 36 - 35 ) for the second straight night on Thursday , winning 106 - 94 . Though not mathematically eliminated , the Knicks remain squarely out of the Eastern Conference playoff picture . However , the team has now won two straight after a back - to - back against the ailing Bulls . All-Star Carmelo Anthony led the team with 26 points , also pulling down seven rebounds . Rookie Kristaps Porzingis also had a big night , notching a 19 - point , 10 - rebound double - double . The Latvian big man also swatted three shots en route to the win . The Bulls have been grappling with major injuries for months , and Thursday was no exception . Key players Pau Gasol and Tony Snell both sat , allowing big man Cristiano Felicio to slide into the starting lineup despite his average of just 7 minutes per game on the season . The Bulls recorded a paltry 15 assists on the night , and the Chicago bench combined for just 20 in the contest . Despite these shortcomings , former MVP Derrick Rose did shine with a big 30 - point scoring night . The Bulls now sit 2 games behind the Pistons in the Eastern Conference playoff race . The Knicks will host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday , while the Bulls will travel to Orlando to take on the Magic .
The Detroit Pistons defeated the Chicago Bulls 102 - 91 at the Palace of Auburn Hills on Tuesday . The Pistons ( 12 - 11 ) , who used a big fourth quarter to pull away from the Bulls ( 11 - 10 ) on Tuesday , are now winners of four of their last five games and look to be trending in the right direction with the return of their point guard Reggie Jackson , who played in his second game of the season since returning from a knee injury . Jackson , however , was again placed on a minutes restriction , playing just 18 minutes , but he still managed to record seven points and seven assists in the outing . It was Tobias Harris who led the way for Detroit , recording a game - high 22 points on top of seven assists in 40 minutes , while Andre Drummond posted a double - double of 15 points and 10 rebounds in just 25 minutes . As a team , the Pistons did n't have a great night from the field , shooting just 45 percent , but they did play very efficient basketball , as they dished out 24 assists to just nine total turnovers . For Chicago , they continue to reel , as they have now lost three in a row and four of their last five games . Despite that , Jimmy Butler continues to have a breakout offensive season , as he posted 32 points , six rebounds and four assists in 43 minutes Tuesday and has now scored at least 26 points in four straight games to start the month of December . Beyond Dwyane Wade 's 19 points , there were n't any other admirable performances against Detroit , as the rest of the starters combined to score just 29 points , while the bench managed to produce a measly 11 points . As a team , the Bulls made just two of their 15 3 - point attempts and recorded just 15 assists to their 14 turnovers . Up next , the Pistons will travel to Charlotte on Wednesday to take on the Hornets , while the Bulls will look to turn things around Thursday at home against the San Antonio Spurs , who remain a perfect 120 on the road .
The Phoenix Suns ( 8 - 5 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 0 - 12 ) 122 - 96 on Friday . Phoenix is in the midst of a six - game road trip . After dropping the first game of the trip 120 - 107 to the Los Angeles Clippers , they 've rattled off three consecutive wins over some of the never - weres of the Eastern Conference . Isaiah Thomas paced the Suns on Friday . He put up 23 points and eight rebounds in 24 minutes off the bench . They 'll continue their trip Saturday in Indiana against the Pacers . Philadelphia has lost 12 straight games to start the season . While that 's a deplorable situation to be in regardless of the situation , it 's in no way a surprise that the Sixers have n't been able to pull off a win . Tony Wroten started at shooting guard next to Michael Carter-Williams on Friday , an experiment the Sixers seemed to be opposed to coming into this season , and it 's a starting lineup that is unlikely to stick . K.J . McDaniels scored a career - high 17 points in 28 minutes , and the fact that he played so many minutes after commenting to the media that he is frustrated with his playing time indicates that the team did n't take much offense to his comments . The Sixers will have a legitmitate chance at their first win of the season Saturday when they go to New York to face the Knicks .
The Boston Celtics defeated the Miami Heat 112 - 104 Monday at AmericanAirlines Arena . The Celtics ( 10 - 7 ) continued to surge with heir fourth win in their last five games . They were led by point guard Isaiah Thomas , who , despite having a poor shooting performance from the field , managed to record 25 points , eight assists and four steals in 35 minutes , and his work has a floor leader propelled the Celtics to have 46 assists to just nine turnovers as a team . Fellow starters on the wing Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder recorded 18 and 17 points respectively , but it was the play of Boston 's bench that really helped get them to victory , with four reserves managing to score 38 points Monday night . For Miami ( 5 - 12 ) , they came into Monday 's game depleted with injuries , with Dion Waiters ( groin ) , Tyler Johnson ( mouth ) and Justise Winslow ( wrist ) all ruled out . Additionally , starting point guard Goran Dragic ( elbow ) and Hassan Whiteside ( knee ) were both listed as questionable but managed to play through their ailments . And they were very impressive despite the injuries , with Dragic posting 27 points and 17 assists and Whiteside posting his own double - double of 25 points on 10 - of - 13 shooting and 17 rebounds . Their efforts , however , were not nearly enough , as the team lacked much of an offensive punch outside of those two . They mainly lacked punch from the outside , as Miami shot just 6 - of - 30 from behind the arc as a team . Up next , the Celtics will look to keep rolling at home Wednesday against the Pistons , while the Heat will head to Denver on Wednesday and play the Nuggets .
Dion Waiters had an surprisingly hot start to the regular season in his first year with the Heat , as he became one of the primary scoring options on a struggling Miami team , but a groin injury in late November derailed the former Syracuse star and left him sidelined for a little over a month . Following his return on Jan. 4 , Waiters found the floor inconsistently as he worked his way back into basketball shape . But now , eight games later , Waiters ' efficiency and production has been out of this world . Following his 33 - point heroic performance against the Warriors on Monday , Waiters has now , in each of his last two games , scored 33 points in 33 minutes , and he has done so at a ridiculous efficiency . In those two performances , Waiters has shot 25 - of - 39 ( 64 percent ) from the field and 11 - of - 16 ( 69 percent ) from behind the arc . Miami , as winners of four straight , is hot , and Waiters is the biggest reason why .
The Phoenix Suns ( 16 - 46 ) finally earned a win against the Orlando Magic ( 27 - 34 ) on Friday , winning 102 - 84 . Third year center Alex Len led the way for the Suns , who have had a major slide and now hold the third - worst record in the NBA . Len posted 31 points and 15 rebounds in one of his strongest outings of 2015 - 16 . Rookie Devin Booker , meanwhile , followed up a 34 - point outing on Thursday with 14 points , four rebounds , and six assists . The 19 - year - old has established himself as a premier rookie and an elite three - point shooter already , early in his stint in the NBA . The Suns earned their win in emphatic fashion , holding the Magic to just 35 percent from the field and out - rebounding the Magic 57 - 50 . The Magic , meanwhile , remain firmly out of the playoff picture , particularly after losing to the NBA 's coldest team . Sophomore Elfrid Payton led the team with 19 points while dishing 11 dimes . The rising star has been hot and cold lately , but continually shows flashes of star potential . Another prospect , rookie Mario Hezonja followed up a career - high on Wednesday with an efficient 12 points and four rebounds on Friday . The Croatian teenager was selected with the fifth pick in the 2015 draft . The Suns will travel to Memphis on Sunday , while the Magic will take on the league - best Warriors in Oakland on Monday .
Joel Embiid continues to be the lone bright spot for the one - win Philadelphia 76ers and is putting up terrific numbers during his 24 - minute restriction through 10 games . Embiid 's six turnovers should not be of much concern , given his ability to grab 10 rebounds and 13 points in just 23 minutes of action , on top of his 6 - of - 10 shooting . The efficiency down low , defensive prowess ( Embiid added two blocks and a steal ) , in addition to his three point shooting ability , make the Kansas product a matchup nightmare for every power forward or center in the league . The foot does not look to be of any concern so far , and head coach Brett Brown has claimed that the young star could see a minutes increase around Christmas . Seems like a great gift for the potential rookie of the year .
The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 19 - 14 ) defeated the Charlotte Hornets ( 10 - 24 ) 91 - 87 on Friday at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte . Both teams struggled with their shooting in this one . The Cavaliers went 38 percent from the floor and 27 percent from the three - point line , while the Hornets went only 37 percent from the floor and 21 percent from beyond the arc . Neither team could really get in a groove , as both failed to reach the 100 - point mark . Cleveland was able to force Charlotte into 15 turnovers , which ultimately may have been the difference . With LeBron James out for the next couple of weeks , as expected Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving took over the majority of the offensive production . Love led all scorers , as he went 9 - for - 15 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to finish with 27 points . After struggling to only seven points on Tuesday , it was good to see him bounce back with an outstanding performance Friday . Irving did n't have his most efficient day , but ended up scoring 23 points ( 8 - 27 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 7 - 8 FT ) in 41 minutes . Over his last five games he 's averaged 27 points , so expect him to continue to get of plenty of shots as his confidence level is through the roof . Dion Waiters had a solid contribution off the bench , as he finished with 17 points and five rebounds . He had 17 of the 24 total bench points for the Cavs . The only other player to reach double figures was Tristan Thompson . He recorded a double - double , as he had 14 points and 14 rebounds . The Hornets top scorer was Gerald Henderson . Henderson went 6 - for - 17 from the floor to score 14 points , while also adding eight rebounds and four assists . He 's combined for 49 points over his last three games , as he 's stepped up his scoring output during the past week . Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was able to add a double - double of his own . He had 12 points and 10 rebounds , giving him his third double - double of the season . Kemba Walker seemed to struggle with his shot . He went only 4 - for - 16 from the field and 1 - for - 8 from the three - point line to score 10 points . Coming off the bench , both Gary Neal and Marvin Williams reach double - digit points with 11 and 10 points respectively . As a team though , the Hornets just did n't have enough offensive production to get them a victory . The Cavaliers ' next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday , while the Hornets will travel to Orlando to play the Magic on Saturday .
The Utah Jazz ( 10 - 10 ) dismantled the New York Knicks ( 10 - 13 ) to the tune of a 106 - 85 scoreline on Wednesday . The Jazz took care of this game early and never allowed the Knicks to fight their way back in it . In fact , Utah was up 49 - 18 in the first 15 minutes and took a 25 - point lead into the half . Utah shot over 50 percent from the field in the first half and amazingly did not commit a turnover until 28 minutes into the game . The Jazz held the Knicks to under 40 percent shooting in the win as well . The Jazz have been playing horrible defense since Rudy Gobert got injured , but they were great here . They held the Knicks starters to just 31 points in the win and allowed just 11 points in the opening quarter . Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors carried the load once again . Hayward tallied 24 points , four rebounds and five assists in the victory . Favors recorded 20 points and eight boards to fall just shy of his fourth - straight double - double . Utah had allowed an average over 110 points per game without Gobert in the lineup , so this defensive performance is a great sign going forward . The Jazz have a much tougher test in their next game , when they host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday . The Knicks were stifled in this game and really didn’t muster up anything until it was too late . No player scored more than 12 points and that 's simply a bad recipe to win a game . Carmelo Anthony led the team with 12 points and five rebounds . Phenom rookie Kristaps Porzingis had one of his worst games of his short career , as he could only provide four points and three rebounds on 2 - for - 8 shooting . This is just one of those game for the Knicks and they can just chalk it up to playing in a tough environment against a stifling defense . They 'll look to bounce - back when they take on the Sacramento Kings on Thursday in the second half of a back - to - back set
The Atlanta Hawks ( 6 - 1 ) outgunned the New Orleans Pelicans ( 0 - 6 ) in a high - scoring affair Friday , winning 121 - 115 . The Pelicans led 28 - 26 after one quarter , but could n't keep pace the rest of the way . Although they managed to tie it up in the fourth quarter at one point , it was n't enough , as the Hawks notched their sixth straight win . Anthony Davis did everything he could to keep his injury - riddled team from tallying another loss . Davis scored an incredible 43 points on 14 - of - 23 shooting , while making 14 - of - 16 free throws . Davis had 10 rebounds , three assists , four steals and three blocks , to go along with his ample scoring . Eric Gordon played well , shooting 8 - of - 15 and scoring 22 points . Ish Smith has been taking advantage of some extra minutes and contributed eight points , 11 assists , and four rebounds in 34 minutes off the bench . Ryan Anderson chipped in 10 points , five rebounds , four assists , and two blocks in 30 minutes off the bench . The Hawks have not missed a beat after last season 's playoff exit and are atop the East once again . Despite losing swingman DeMarre Carroll in the offseason , Kent Bazemore has since stepped in as starting small forward and has been fitting in just fine . Bazemore had 10 points , five rebounds , four assists , three steals , and one block Friday . Atlanta was led in scoring by Kyle Korver with 22 points and a 4 - of - 4 showing from deep , while Paul Millsap had 22 points to go with 11 rebounds . Jeff Teague led the team in assists with seven while scoring 19 points . The Hawks , just like last season , continued to move the ball very well and ended up with an impressive 30 team assists on 41 made field goals . The Hawks get right back to business Saturday , as the Washington Wizards come to town for a division battle . The Pelicans will also be right back in action Saturday when they visit the Dallas Mavericks .
The Utah Jazz defeated the Philadelphia 76ers , 109 - 84 , at Wells Fargo Center on Monday . The Jazz ( 5 - 3 ) learned earlier in the day that standout point guard George Hill would miss the game with the sprained thumb that has been bothering him for the last couple of days , leaving Shelvin Mack and Dante Exum to soak up most of the minutes in his stead . Given that the veteran had gotten his Utah tenure off to a highly productive start , his absence could have left an offensive void , particularly on the road . However , the remainder of the squad , led by Gordon Hayward in only his second game back from a preseason finger injury , made up for Hill 's production with a stellar shooting night . The Jazz posted success rates of 51 and 58 percent from the field and three - point range , respectively , leading to a comfortable victory . Hayward tallied 20 points , seven rebounds , five assists and a steal , giving him at least 20 in the scoring column in both of his first two games back on the court . Rodney Hood was next with 18 points , two rebounds , an assist and a steal . Derrick Favors , playing a season - high 29 minutes , exploded for a 16 - point , 14 - rebound double - double that also included an assist , a steal and three blocks . Mack and Exum combined for 19 points on 7 - of - 12 shooting , with the latter 's point total pacing the reserves . The Sixers ( 0 - 6 ) saw their big men lead the way in scoring , no small feat against the Jazz frontcourt . Jahlil Okafor , who ceded the start to Joel Embiid , actually paced Philadelphia with 15 points , and he complemented the scoring with four rebounds , an assist and a block . Embiid followed with a near double - double of 14 points , nine boards , a steal and a block . Robert Covington contributed 12 points , eight rebounds and an assist , with the scoring total representing a season high . Ersan Ilyasova supplied 10 points , three rebounds and two assists , his third time with double - digit scoring in as many games with the Sixers . The Jazz continue on to Charlotte for a date with the Hornets on Wednesday , while the Sixers head to Indiana to face the Pacers in their own Wednesday night tilt .
The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the visiting Detroit Pistons , 106 - 88 , at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Saturday . The Thunder ( 10 - 8 ) had every reason to be a bit sluggish Saturday , after a marathon 132 - 129 overtime victory over the Nuggets on Friday . However , while they did n't quite put on the offensive display of a night prior , Oklahoma City rode Russell Westbrook 's sixth triple - double of the season to another win . The perennial All-Star was only 8 - of - 22 from the floor but still managed 17 points , 15 assists , 13 rebounds , a steal and a block . It was the 44th time in his career that Westbrook had accomplished the feat , tying him with LeBron James .

Tobias Harris spearheaded Detroit ( 8 - 10 ) with 21 points , four rebounds , an assist and three steals . Ish Smith posted 14 points , three assists and a rebound . A trio of 10 - point efforts from Marcus Morris , Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Andre Drummond rounded out the starting five 's night . Jon Leuer led the bench with eight points and three rebounds .

Victor Oladipo actually led the Thunder in scoring with 18 points , a total that he supplemented with six rebounds , two assists and a steal . Steven Adams had a near double - double with 16 points , nine boards and a steal . Anthony Morrow was outstanding off the bench with 21 points , a rebound and an assist over 26 minutes .

The host New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Portland Trail Blazers , 113 - 101 , at Smoothie King Center on Friday .

Portland will look to crack this three - game losing streak when they travel to Brooklyn to play the Nets on Sunday for their next game . New Orleans ( 3 - 10 ) got Jrue Holiday back in this win and it 's clear how much he means to this team . In his debut , he led the bench with 21 points and seven assists in 23 minutes of action . Anthony Davis carried the load though , tallying 38 points , nine rebounds , six assists and four blocks in the win . Tim Frazier got the start at point guard , scoring 12 points and dishing out eight assists .

The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 30 ) defeated the Boston Celtics ( 0 - 3 ) , 103 - 95 , Thursday at the TD Garden to take a 30 lead in their series . Boston looked to change its fortunes in Game 3 on its home court after dropping the first two games of the series in Cleveland . The Celtics hung close throughout the game and when Evan Turner , who had his best game of the series , hit a three to cut the Cavaliers ' lead to three with 2:45 remaining , it looked as though tide was turning in Boston 's favor . Cleveland extinguished that momentum almost immediately as Kevin Love drained a corner three on the next possession to put the Cavaliers back up by six . Love had his best game of the postseason with 23 points and nine rebounds , including two big - time three pointers in the fourth quarter .

Thompson 's five offensive rebounds allowed Cleveland to retain possession at key moments down the stretch to let the Cavaliers to run out the clock . The Cavaliers will look to finish out the series Sunday in Boston . Boston 's ability to hang close with Cleveland was made all the more impressive by the fact that it 's best scorer , Isaiah Thomas , was a non - factor for most of the game . Thomas , who had scored 22 points in each of Boston 's first two games of the postseason , was held to just five points on 2 - of - 9 shooting . To offset Thomas ' quiet night off the bench , Jae Crowder made a lot of noise in his 31 minutes on the floor . Crowder was all over the court , forcing jump balls , nabbing two steals , and blocking four shots to go with seven rebounds and 16 points . The Celtics will need a similar performance from Crowder in Game 4 , as well as a bigger outing from Thomas , in order to extend the series on Sunday .

The Chicago Bulls defeated the Golden State Warriors , 94 - 87 , at United Center on Thursday evening . The Warriors ( 50 - 11 ) knew that they 'd have a massive challenge on their hands in trying to make up for the extended absence of Kevin Durant ( knee ) , but also had to have a certain measure of confidence knowing that the Splash Bros. tandem that had been vastly successful before Durant 's arrival were ready to chuck away . That strategy fell woefully short Thursday , not necessarily in the margin of defeat , but rather , in overall offensive efficiency . Golden State shot an atypical 39 percent from the floor , including an unsightly 20 percent ( 6 - for - 30 ) from behind the arc . Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson were particularly aggressive as expected , yet managed to drain only 15 of their combined 49 shot attempts . The Bulls ( 31 - 30 ) also won the battle down low , outrebounding the visitors by a 49 - 41 margin . Curry did lead the Warriors with 23 points , six rebounds , five assists and five steals . Thompson was a distant second , netting only 13 points ( 5 - 22 FG , 1 - 11 3Pt ) along with one rebound and one assist .

Tarik Black posted nine points and 10 boards . D'Angelo Russell ( four points , six assists , two rebounds ) was minimally involved , but Jordan Clarkson ( 12 points ) and rookie Ivica Zubac ( 10 points ) were productive as reserves as well .

Justin Holiday ( 14 points ) and Kyle O'Quinn ( 10 points ) followed , and Willy Hernangomez hauled in 13 boards off the bench .
While the start of the Grizzlies ' season has been pretty standard with a 5 - 5 start , Vince Carter 's play has been anything but . With his 20 - point performance on Monday , Carter notched 20 points for the second time in three games and at least 17 points for the third straight game . While Chandler Parson 's return from a knee injury was expected to lead to a much - reduced role for Carter , it 's done the exact opposite , as with Parson 's struggling as he still works to make his way back to the floor , Carter has excelled and outscored Parsons in each of the past three games . Carter 's 9 points per game would be his highest average since the 2013 - 14 season . For the Jazz , they received an unexpected 20 - point performance from Joe Ingles on Monday - - a performance that kept the team in the game with Gordon Hayward struggling to get anything going . Ingles had n't scored in double figures all season until Monday , and with Derrick Favors potentially out , the team could look to Ingles to provide some added scoring on a more consistent basis when they 're a man down .
The Oklahoma City Thunder ( 9 - 6 ) showed the up and coming Utah Jazz ( 6 - 7 ) who is boss , with a definitive 111 - 89 victory on Monday night .

Durant also added six rebounds and four steals in 30 minutes . Russell Westbrook dropped 20 points , including 10 - 10 from the free throw line , along with nine assists and seven rebounds in 27 minutes .

The Cavaliers ( 45 - 22 ) came into Thursday fairly desperate for a win , as they 'd dropped four of six games and had the Boston Celtics nipping at their heels , only two games behind for the top seed in the Eastern Conference . Despite being faced with essentially the toughest defense in the NBA in the Jazz ( 43 - 26 ) and losing Kyrie Irving ( knee tightness ) and Iman Shumpert ( shoulder ) within the game , Cleveland overcame the tough odds to prevail on the strength of a LeBron James 33 - point , 10 - rebound double - double that also included six assists , two steals and one block .

All-NBA center DeMarcus Cousins continued a dominant string of performances , delivering 29 points and 12 rebounds along with a substantial defensive output of three steals and three blocks . The volatile Cousins was suspended for the Kings ' Thursday matchup against the Heat for a forearm punch to Hawks center Al Horford . Aside from that absence , however , Cousins has been on a tear since returning from an injured achilles , posting five double - doubles and logging two 35+ point games . While many predicted a reduced role for Sacramento point guard Rajon Rondo upon the return of backup Darren Collison , coach George Karl instead elected to trot the two guards out alongside one another in Orlando . Rondo , who has been averaging an NBA-leading 10 assists per game , saw a team - high 42 minutes in Orlando . It seems that Karl is committed to keeping the veteran point guard a major part of the Kings ' rotations . The story of the night for the Magic , meanwhile , was inconsistency behind the arc . The team shot just 29 percent from behind the three - point line , including 3 - for - 11 from shooting guard Evan Fournier . Orlando will hope to get back on track as they prepare for a difficult matchup against the conference - leading Cavs in Cleveland . Sacramento , on the other hand , has been picking up steam of late , and will hope to carry this momentum into their matchup against Charlotte on Monday .

The Los Angeles Lakers ( 8 - 27 ) defeated the Phoenix Suns ( 12 - 25 ) 97 - 77 on Sunday . The Lakers have largely suffered through a miserable 2015 - 16 campaign so far , with Kobe Bryant 's league - wide retirement tour and the positive vibes it 's generated serving as their primary source of pride and optimism . However , Los Angeles has slowly begun showing signs of life in recent games , with their mix of young and veteran pieces starting to gel . With Sunday 's dominating victory , a game in which they led by as much as 30 at one point , the Lakers have now won a season - high three straight games . It 's their first such streak since last February , and while not a notable winning stretch for most other teams in the NBA , it could certainly be an indicator of a progressively improving squad . Phoenix continues to struggle on offense without Eric Bledsoe , who is out for the season after knee surgery . Backcourt mate Brandon Knight is certainly doing his best to hold down the fort , and led the Suns in scoring Sunday with 25 points and nine assists . It was his second consecutive 20 - point - plus effort , and he 's now put up a robust 62 shot attempts over the last three games , a tangible indicator of the offensive responsibility the five - year pro is shouldering . Unfortunately for both Phoenix and Knight , Bledsoe 's replacement , rookie Devin Booker , was the only other starter who posted double - digit scoring , managing 10 points and adding four rebounds , an assist and a steal . Mirza Teletovic paced the reserves with 16 points , eight rebounds and an assist , his third straight game with double - digit points . Tyson Chandler ( two points ) , Jon Leuer ( four points ) and P.J . Tucker ( five points ) led a parade of underwhelming offensive efforts for the Suns , who also were hampered by a shockingly scoreless outing from T.J. Warren over 21 minutes off the bench . Phoenix fell to 12 - 25 and continues in fourth place in the Westen Conference 's Pacific Division . They head home to face the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday . The home team was spearheaded by an explosive performance from two - guard Louis Williams , who collected a season - high 30 points and also equaled a season best by hauling in seven rebounds . The veteran drained a season - best six three - pointers as well , managing his best shooting night from long range on the season ( 86 percent ) . Larry Nance , Jr. posted an impressive double - double in support of Williams ' effort , posting 15 points and 14 boards . Roy Hibbert ( 13 points ) and Jordan Clarkson ( 12 points ) were the other starters to also reach double - digit scoring , and the pair also stuffed the stat sheet in other categories . The former added six rebounds , three assists and three blocks , while the latter supplemented his points with seven assists , five rebounds , three steals and a block . Brandon Bass led the Los Angeles bench with an eight - point outing . The Lakers improved to 8 - 27 but remain in last place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They 'll be home again on Tuesday for a date with the reigning NBA champion Golden State Warriors .
Indiana are in desperate need of a winning streak and this dominant result is a good start to that run .

The Houston Rockets ( 7 - 10 ) defeated the New York Knicks ( 8 - 10 ) 116 - 111 in overtime on Sunday . The Knicks learned before the game that Carmelo Anthony would miss the contest with an illness , setting the stage for additional offensive responsibility for offseason acquisition Arron Afflalo . The veteran shooting guard resoundingly answered the bell , posting a season - high and game - high 31 points on an outstanding 13 - of - 19 shooting performance . Six of those points came in the extra period , as the Knicks pulled even with the Rockets at 111 before Houston was able to pull away . Afflalo 's effort was part of a remarkable 58 percent shooting night for the Knicks , which notably accomplished the feat in Anthony 's absence .

Kristaps Porzingis supported Afflalo 's stellar performance with a huge double - double that consisted of 20 points and 13 rebounds , along with an assist , a steal and a pair of blocks . Lance Thomas also turned in a solid game in a spot start in Anthony 's stead , amassing 15 points and three rebounds . However , Jose Calderon ( seven points , five rebounds , four assists and a steal ) and Robin Lopez ( scoreless over 15 minutes , with three rebounds , two assists and a block ) could not do much to support New York 's offensive cause . Kevin Seraphin paced the Knicks ' bench with a 14 - point , seven - rebound outing , his second consecutive double - digit scoring game . Derrick Williams also represented the reserves well , managing 12 points and four rebounds . The Knicks fell to 8 - 10 and currently reside in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They next face the Sixers in a home tilt on Wednesday . Although James Harden once again paced the Rockets ' offense with 26 points , seven rebounds and nine assists , it was clutch three - pointers by Marcus Thornton and Trevor Ariza in the fourth quarter and overtime , respectively , that helped guarantee a hard - fought victory . Thornton led Houston 's bench with 18 points , an assist and a steal , and drained a long - range bucket with 32 seconds left in regulation to knot the score at 101 . Ariza assisted on another Thornton trey in overtime , and then sank his own shot from beyond the arc with 1:12 left in the extra period to close out a 16 - point , seven - rebound night that also included an assist and a pair of steals . Clint Capela put forward another outstanding effort in a spot start in place of Terrence Jones , posting an 18 - point , 11 - rebound double - double , his second consecutive and third in his last four games . Dwight Howard was the fourth Houston starter to tally double - digit scoring , collecting 14 points and hauling in six boards .

The Jazz flustered James Harden all night , holding the MVP candidate to just 15 points on 3 of 13 shooting . The Jazz will have a chance to even the season series with the Rockets at two when they square off on the final day of the regular season .

To add to that , the Suns also out - rebounded the Sixers 48 - 41 giving them even more of an advantage in securing a victory in front of their home crowd . The Suns were led by Markieff Morris and Gerald Green . Morris had a very strong game shooting the ball , going 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 21 points in 21 minutes . He 's now combined for 46 points over his last two outings , continuing to show the hot hand . Green on the other hand came off the bench for 21 points ( 9 - 15 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt ) of his own . He 's been a consistent option for the Suns off the bench , as he 's now averaging 14 points per game this year . Eric Bledsoe had a strong showing as well . He went 6 - for - 14 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 17 points , while also recording eight assists .

Michael Carter-Williams also had a solid all - around game . He finished with 17 points ( 8 - 20 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt ) , seven rebounds and five assists in 34 minutes . He had a very poor showing on Tuesday against the Golden State Warriors , where he had only four points in 38 minutes , so it was nice bounce back game for him . Henry Sims was another strong bench contributor . He went 6 - for - 7 from the field to score 16 points . He 's combined for 35 points over his last two games despite averaging only 10 points on the season . The Suns ' next game will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Sunday , while the Sixers will travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Saturday .
The Los Angeles Clippers ( 53 - 26 ) held off the Los Angeles Lakers ( 20 - 57 ) , 105 - 100 , on Tuesday at the Staples Center . Tuesday 's game was the second half of the Clippers and Lakers `` home - and - home '' set that started Sunday . The Clippers routed the Lakers 106 - 78 in that game , but Tuesday 's game proved to be far more competitive . The Lakers hung close throughout Tuesday 's contest thanks to rookie Jordan Clarkson 's 20 point , six assist outing , but the Clippers ' timely shooting helped seal their seventh straight victory over their cross - town rival . The Lakers have now dropped four straight and seven of their last nine overall . Jordan Clarkson shared ball handling duties with Jeremy Lin , who produced 14 points and five assists over 24 minutes on the floor . The Lakers will play the second half of a back - to - back set Wednesday when they travel to Denver to take on the Nuggets . The Clippers could ill - afford to drop a winnable game Tuesday after the Spurs tied their record with a blowout win over the Thunder . Despite some occasional sloppy play that allowed the Lakers to stay close , the Clippers took care of business to notch their 53rd win on the season . Jamal Crawford returned to the floor Tuesday after missing over a month with a calf injury . Crawford showed a some rust , finishing with just four points on 2 - of - 7 shooting in 19 minutes , but should be able to round back into form for the postseason . Chris Paul recorded 10 assists in the game , marking 25 total assists since his last turnover . The Clippers are off until Saturday when they host the Grizzlies in a matchup with potentially major playoff implications .
The Dallas Mavericks ( 49 - 31 ) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers ( 21 - 59 ) 120 - 106 on Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles . It was another nice victory for the Mavericks , who have now extended their winning streak to three straight games . They 're already locked in as the seventh seed in the Western Conference standings , so they 'll look to continue to build their momentum with the playoffs on the verge of beginning . The Lakers have been eliminated from the playoffs for quite some time now , but the loss only helps their cause , as a worse record increases the potential for a higher landing spot for the 2015 NBA Draft . With the fourth worst record in the league , it 's almost a sure thing they 'll get a very high pick come draft day . The Mavericks were the superior shooters in this game , going 54 percent from the field and 48 percent from the three - point line , while the Lakers finished at 44 percent from the floor and 38 percent from deep . It was Tyson Chandler who surprisingly led the team in scoring . He went 9 - for - 10 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the free throw line to score a team - high of 20 points , while also adding nine rebounds and two blocked shots . The Lakers were just too young and inexperienced in their frontcourt , as Chandler was able to have a field day . It was just the fourth time all season that he reached the 20 - point mark , so it was easily one of his best offensive performances of the year . Richard Jefferson also gave a solid contribution . In 27 minutes as a starter , he finished with 17 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 7 - 9 FT ) and three rebounds . He 's shot very well over his last two games and has combined for 41 points during that span , so he 'll look to keep his confidence high going into the playoffs . Dirk Nowitzki was the third starter in double figures , as he recorded 16 points ( 5 - 10 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) and four rebounds . He 's now averaging 19 points over his last seven games . Coming off the bench , Charlie Villanueva added 14 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 3 - 6 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) and four rebounds , while Raymond Felton chipped in with 15 points ( 7 - 10 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt ) and three assists . The Lakers production was very spread out through their lineup Sunday , with seven players reaching double - digit points . Jordan Clarkson led the way , finishing with a game - high of 26 points ( 9 - 19 FG , 3 - 6 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) , to go along with six assists and two steals . The rookie has been a very nice surprise for the Lakers so far this season , as he 's averaged 21 points and 8 assists over his last four games . Clarkson received some help from Wesley Johnson though . Johnson went 6 - for - 9 from the field and 4 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score an efficient 16 points over 20 minutes . He had shot below 40 percent from the field in four out of his last five games coming into Sunday , so it was good to see him finally have some better success in this one . While it was n't his best game shooting the ball , Jabari Brown still posted 18 points ( 4 - 13 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 8 - 9 FT ) and two assists over 42 minutes . He 's combined for 38 points and nine assists over his last two games , moving his season averages to 10 points and 2 assists over 17 games with the Lakers . The Lakers ' next game will be on the road against the Sacramento Kings on Monday , while the Kings will travel to Utah to play the Jazz on Monday .
The Houston Rockets ( 50 - 23 ) defeated the Washington Wizards ( 41 - 32 ) , 99 - 91 , on Sunday at the Verizon Center . Sunday 's earliest game got off to a sluggish start , especially for the Wizards . For much of the game , Washington 's John Wall appeared to be the only Wizard that was playing at full speed . Houston started to let its lead slip away during the fourth quarter when Washington 's Otto Porter canned a three to cut it to four . The Rockets answered with consecutive three pointers to extend the lead back to double digits . Every time the Wizards would start to embark on a comeback , the Rockets had an answer . The `` Hack a Howard '' strategy backfired for the Wizards as Dwight Howard hit five of his eight free throw attempts . Bradley Beal had a chance to cut Houston 's lead to three late in the game , but had his shot rejected by James Harden , which all but sealed it for Houston . Houston has now won four in a row , three of which have come on the road . The Rockets are the third - best road team in the league , behind only the Hawks and Warriors with a 23 - 13 mark away from the Toyota Center . Sunday 's win temporarily puts Houston in a tie with Memphis for the second sweed in the West . The Grizzlies could fall behind the Rockets if they are unable to notch a victory in San Antonio later in the day Sunday . James Harden led the team in scoring with 24 points on 7 - of - 20 shooting . The Rockets will play the second part of a back - to - back set Monday at the Raptors . Washington snapped its four - game losing streak Friday with an overtime win against Charlotte , but was unable to notch its second straight win Sunday . John Wall barely missed out on a triple - double , finishing with 25 points , 12 assists , and eight rebounds . The Wizards are looking more and more cemented in the fifth spot in the East as they now trail the Raptors by two games . Washington is off until Wednesday when it hosts Philadelphia .
The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the host Atlanta Hawks , 115 - 105 , at Philips Arena on Monday . Atlanta were expected to win this game easily with the recent form of Los Angeles , but the Clippers back - ups fought hard for an important road win . The bench was the difference in the game , with the Clippers bench outscoring the Hawks bench , 38 - 13 . Three-point shooting was a huge factor as well , with Los Angeles going 14 - of - 24 , while Atlanta hit just 9 - of - 29 from long distance .

Paul Millsap flirted with a triple - double , amassing 19 points , eight rebounds and seven assists . Dwight Howard recorded a 16 - point , 12 - rebound double - double .

The Knicks managed the close the lead to three points at halftime , and the Kings never led by double - digits in the second half , but the early lead they built up was enough to hold off New York 's anemic offense , which was clearly feeling the loss of Carmelo Anthony , who was out with migraines .

The Wizards have been more reliant than ever on All-Star point guard John Wall over the last three - plus weeks while Bradley Beal has been sidelined with his lower leg injury , and he has largely responded in fine form . While veteran Garrett Temple has generally done a solid job in Beal 's stead , he has considerably cooled off since a three - game stretch in mid - to - late December where he tallied over 20 points in each contest . It was Wall 's turn to save the day again Friday , as he led Washington to a 31 - 19 fourth quarter that allowed them to pull away from the pesky Magic . The 25 - year - old impressively tallied 12 points and five assists in the final period to spearhead the Wizards ' offensive attack and secure the victory .

The Magic dropped to 19 - 14 and momentarily reside in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division , a position that could drop down one slot should the Miami Heat defeat the Mavericks later in the evening . Orlando heads to Cleveland for a showdown with the Cavaliers on Saturday . Wall led Washington with an overall tally of 24 points , 13 assists , two rebounds , a pair of steals and a block .

Despite most preseason projections placing the Blazers squarely in the lottery , the surprising young team has emerged as the sixth - place team in the Western Conference with a real chance to make it to fifth by the season 's end .

The Chicago Bulls ( 6 - 2 ) beat the Detroit Pistons ( 2 - 5 ) 102 - 91 on Monday night at the United Center in Chicago .

The Suns and the Nets represent two of the worst records in the NBA this season . With this result Phoenix suffered its 13th straight loss , tying a franchise - high . This loss also marked a franchise - high eighth - straight home loss for the Suns . Although they are far out of the playoff race , the Nets have been playing slightly better as of late , winning four of their last eight games , after a horrible stretch during which they lost 15 of 17 . The Nets waived Joe Johnson early on Thursday , which gave some of their younger players a chance to showcase their skills in this contest and they did just that . Bojan Bogdanovic recorded a career - high 24 points ( 8 - 16 FG , 3 - 9 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) , in 38 minutes , while Markel Brown chipped in 16 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 2 - 2 3Pt , 6 - 8 FT ) , along with three rebounds , one assist and one steal , in 24 minutes off the bench .

Phoenix did not do a good job of controlling the ball and establishing rhythm as they gave up 21 turnovers and recorded only 16 assists on 42 made field goals . Mirza Teletovic stood out as a bright spot for the Suns , as he tallied 30 points ( 12 - 23 FG , 5 - 13 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) , along with 11 rebounds , in 30 minutes off the bench .

The Golden State Warriors defeated the visiting Portland Trail Blazers , 110 - 99 , to take a 20 series lead in the Western Conference semifinals Tuesday at Oracle Arena . Through three quarters , the Blazers frustrated the Warriors shooters and kept Klay Thompson in check . Damian Lillard was lights out in the third quarter and led the Blazers to a nine point lead heading into the final period , but a 34 - 12 fourth quarter blowout progressed the home team to a commanding 20 series lead . The depth of the Warriors was on display , as Festus Ezeli scored the first eight points of the fourth quarter , which helped narrow the Portland lead . From there on out , it was the Draymond Green and Klay Thompson show , as both players helped from behind the arc and inside the paint , while the Portland shooters went ice cold . With 55 seconds remaining in regulation , Andre Iguodala put back the dagger dunk to extend the Warriors lead to nine points . Thompson led all scorers with 27 points , and fell two three - pointers shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to drain seven - plus three - pointers in four consecutive games .

Shaun Livingston played 33 minutes in the absence of Stephen Curry , and contributed 14 points , including a sweet looking turnaround jumper later in the fourth quarter . Iguodala led the bench with 15 points , five rebounds and four assists . Lillard almost single handedly carried the Blazers in his impressive third quarter scoring spree , but the tight knit defense that was presented by Golden State late in the game frustrated the point guard . The Weber State product and de facto leader of the Blazers finished with 25 points , four rebounds and six assists on 8 - of - 20 shooting . C.J . McCollum bounced back after a quiet Game 1 and added 22 points on 9 - of - 19 shooting , while Mason Plumlee six points , 11 rebounds and four assists . The Blazers were inefficient from the free throw line , and the additional points that could have came from the charity stripe would have only extended the early lead they got off to . Portland finished 14 - of - 21 from the stipe , as compared to the Warriors nearly perfect 18 - of - 20 free throw shooting . Game 3 moves to Portland , and will take place on Saturday .

After coming out of the first quarter down by 11 , the Clippers took off in the second behind Blake Griffin , out - scoring the Rockets 41 - 21 to take a nine - point lead into the half . While it looked as if the Clippers had all the momentum , it was instead all Rockets in the second half , as they finally got into a rhythm and took advantage of a Clippers ' team who was without Chris Paul . The Clippers shot 45 percent from the field and 24 percent from the three - point line , while the Rockets finished at 43 percent from the field and just 19 percent from deep . James Harden was a big reason the Rockets finally turned things around in the second half . He finished with 32 points ( 7 - 17 FG , 3 - 10 3Pt ) , 16 of which came in the fourth quarter , while also adding three rebounds and seven assists . He did have seven turnovers though , so it was n't all good for the guard . While he hit only 30 percent of his three - point shots , Harden did what he does best and got to the free throw line . He went a perfect 15 - of - 15 from the line , helping the Rockets shoot a whopping 64 free throws . Harden did receive a ton of help from Dwight Howard though . Howard went just 8 - for - 21 from the free throw line , but he still managed to score 24 points ( 8 - 11 FG ) in 35 minutes . Howard recorded 16 rebounds and four blocked shots as well , helping the Rockets to secure a 54 - 40 rebounding advantage , which also made a big difference . Trevor Ariza chipped in with a 15 - point ( 4 - 12 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) , 13 - rebound double - double as well . Right from the start , Blake Griffin knew he 'd have to do the bulk of the work for this team with Chris Paul still sidelined . Griffin recorded 14 points in the first quarter alone , and then went on to score a game - high of 34 points ( 13 - 23 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 8 - 11 FT ) , while also adding 15 rebounds and four assists . He was making jump shots , getting in the post , basically doing everything he wanted all night , but the Clippers just did n't play enough defense in the second half to come out successful . Griffin is averaging an impressive 25 points , 13 rebounds and 8 assists over the first nine games of the playoffs , but he 'll welcome the return of Chris Paul with open arms for game three . DeAndre Jordan notched a double - double of his own , recording 16 points ( 6 - 6 FG , 4 - 6 FT ) , 12 rebounds and two blocked shots . He 's now posted double - digit rebounds in eight of nine playoff games . Jamal Crawford added 19 points off the bench , but he shot just 6 - for - 22 from the field and 1 - for - 8 from the three - point line , as he seemed to struggle with his shot . These teams will now head to Los Angeles for game three on Friday .
The Chicago Bulls ( 42 - 28 ) defeated the Toronto Raptors ( 41 - 28 ) 108 - 92 on Friday in Chicago . Nikola Mirotic continues to act as the best player on this Bulls team as of late , as Friday night he scored a game - high 29 points on 11 - of - 21 shooting , grabbed 11 rebounds and blocked four shots in 32 minutes . Injuries have plagued Chicago , and it has been Mirotic 's play that has allowed the Bulls to continue winning regardless .

DeMar Derozan lead the way for the Raptors in the losing effort , recording 27 points on 8 - of - 14 shooting , seven rebounds and three assists in 37 minutes . Unfortunately for Toronto , the rest of the team was unable to contribute much more , as Greivis Vasquez served as the only other starter who scored in double figures , putting up 11 points , six assists and four rebounds in 37 minutes . Vasquez got the start after Kyle Lowry was ruled out prior to the game with a back injury . Patrick Patterson scored a solid 17 points on 7 - of - 11 shooting in 25 minutes off the bench , but as a team , the Raptors shot a poor 38 percent from the field .

The Lakers forward is averaging 14 points , 8 rebounds and 3 assists per game while shooting 60 percent overall . Randle continued the strong start with 18 points on 6 - of - 9 shooting against the Phoenix Suns in the win on Sunday .

As for the bench , Brandon Ingram , Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson all saw more than 25 minutes of action .

Nemanja Bjelica was the secret weapon though , as he got his first start of the season and set season - highs with 24 points , eight rebounds and three steals . The bench is the only reason Los Angeles hung around , as they outscored their starters 52 - 47 and the Timberwolves bench 52 - 20 .

It was a game of runs , but the Clippers were able to stay in control for majority of the game because they simply had a response for every run the Spurs were able to go on . It was one of the best performances this Los Angeles team has put together all season , as they dominated a San Antonio team that has been playing its best basketball of the season at the right time . Both Chris Paul and Blake Griffin lead the charge for the Clippers . Paul ( 13 - 19 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt ) recorded a game - high 32 points to go along with six rebounds and six assists in 35 minutes , while Griffin put together a double - double of 26 points ( 9 - 20 FG , 8 - 10 FT ) and 12 rebounds while also adding six assists , three steals and three blocks in 41 minutes .

Kawhi Leonard led the way scoring for San Antonio , posting 18 points ( 7 - 12 FG ) , six rebounds and four steals in a team - high 33 minutes . Four other Spurs scored in double figures , but none of them eclipsed 11 , with Tim Duncan and Marco Belinelli each posting 11 points and Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili each scoring 10 .

Houston was expected to win this game easily and they did just that , as they never trailed after the first five minutes . In fact , the Rockets won all four quarters en route to their 22 - point win . Defense was key , as they held Dallas to 40 percent shooting and won the rebounding differential , 48 - 32 .

The recent form of these teams would indicate an easy Cleveland win , but that did n't take into consideration the circumstances .

LeBron James did all he could though , as he tallied 31 points , eight rebounds and seven assists in the loss . Jordan McRae got the start for Irving and finished second on the team with 21 points .

More importantly , though , Leonard sank the game - winning jumper with 2 seconds remaining in the game to earn the win for his team . He truly put the team on his back , as he was the only Spur to attempt more than nine field goals on the night . He led the team in not only points and rebounds , but steals as well , as he recorded three takeaways on the defensive end . It was a night to remember for the MVP contender and reigning two - time Defensive Player of the Year . Indiana ( 31 - 30 ) kept it impressively close with the powerhouse Spurs . Star forward Paul George led the team on offense despite shooting just 5 - of - 18 . George had 22 points and went a perfect 10 - of - 10 at the free - throw line . One area that sank the Pacers was three - point shooting , as the team hit only 29 percent of its shots from beyond the arc .

Philadelphia took a 98 - 97 lead on a Carl Landry hook shot with 3:22 to go in the game .

But Covington made just one of the two free throws to give the Nuggets an opening . Lacking a time out , the Nuggets had to go the length of the floor , and Emmanuel Mudiay sank a three - point shot from near midcourt at the buzzer to give the Nuggets the comeback victory .

Six players scored in double figures for Mavericks , including Charlie Villanueva who scored 13 points in 21 minutes off the bench .

They 'll try to keep the good times rolling when they host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday . Los Angeles played their third straight game without Kobe Bryant . Bryant continues to sit out due to general soreness as a result of his 36 - year - old body having a lot of NBA miles on it . In two of the games Bryant missed , the Lakers have been competitive while sharing the ball , causing some to question how much Bryant has helped or hurt the team this season by his singular style of play . The Lakers shot just 36 percent from the floor and gave up 19 easy points off turnovers to give away Friday 's game . Los Angeles has lost five of their last six games , and they 'll try to stop the bleeding when they host the Phoenix Suns on Sunday .
The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder ( 0 - 2 ) 93 - 90 on Thursday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles . Russell Westbrook left the game in the first quarter with a broken right hand and did not return to the game . It is unclear how long Westbrook will be out with the injury , but some reports suggested he could miss a few as two weeks . With Kevin Durant already sidelined due to foot surgery for at least the first month of the season , the Thunder are in danger of digging a hole to start their season that may be too deep to crawl out of and reach the playoffs in the Western Conference . In addition to Durant , the Thunder are also dealing with injuries to Anthony Morrow , Mitch McGary , Jeremy Lamb , Grant Jerrett , and Reggie Jackson . They may only have eight healthy players for their next game if no one returns to action Saturday against the Denver Nuggets . The Clippers could n't create much separation from Oklahoma City despite all of the injuries the Thunder are dealing with . Spencer Hawes was brought in this offseason to help shore up the Clippers ' frontcourt depth by giving them a versatile shooter off the bench . It was expected Hawes might carve out a big enough role to steal some minutes from starters Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan , but that was n't the case in the opener as Hawes played just 19 minutes off the bench , while Griffin played 38 and Jordan played 35 . The Clippers finish off a back - to - back set to start the season on Friday when they play Lakers .
Boston held off Philadelphia 's strong start and claimed a resounding 112 - 95 victory in their home opener . The third pick of the 2015 draft , Jahlil Okafor , was the story of the game in his debut . He put up 26 points and seven rebounds on 10 - 16 shooting from the field and 6 - 6 from the line . The rookie also committed eight turnovers . Unfortunately , his effort was n't enough to keep the 76ers in the game . The other bright spot for the 76ers was second year forward Nerlens Noel , who filled up the stat sheet with 14 points , 12 rebounds , two assists , three steals , and two blocks in 35 minutes . Isaiah Canaan also chipped in 18 points and 7 rebounds . Philadelphia will welcome Utah into town Friday , and will look for their first win of the season . Isaiah Thomas led the way for Boston off the bench with 27 points and seven assists in 29 minutes of action . The Celtics front court looks to be a fluid situation to start the season with Tyler Zeller starting but only playing 10 minutes . Jared Sullinger and Amir Johnson played 21 and 20 minutes respectively off the bench , while newly aquired David Lee started and played 22 minutes . Boston will play at home again Friday versus Toronto and look to start the season 20 .
The Los Angeles Lakers ( 4 - 21 ) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks ( 10 - 16 ) 113 - 95 on Tuesday . After Milwaukee beat the undefeated Golden State Warriors in their most recent game , fans hoped they came out of their slump . Clearly not , as the Lakers handled them here in a blowout win . The Lakers had a 20 - point lead after three quarters and this game was well out of hand before the final buzzer . The rebounding was the big difference , as the Lakers grabbed 52 to Milwaukee 's 38 . The free - throw shooting was a huge disparity as well , as the Lakers hit 21 - of - 25 while the Bucks went just 11 - for - 20 . Milwaukee was coming off one of their biggest wins in team history , but it doesn’t matter much anymore after losing to a four - win Lakers team . They still want 1 - 1 in those two games like everyone expected and that win means almost nothing now . This team continues to play poorly on both ends and there doesn’t seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel . Michael Carter-Williams was the lone bright spot in this game , as he tallied 19 points , five rebounds and five assists off the bench . They did have to play this game without Greg Monroe and that left them with very little post presence . Monroe missed the game due to some knee soreness and his status is up in the air for Milwaukee 's next game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday . The Lakers have been struggling mightily all season , but this was a great all - around performance . Seven players scored in double - figures with Kobe Bryant leading the team with 22 points . The bench was espcially good , as youngsters Julius Randle and D'Angelo Russell both played well here . Randle recorded a 14 point - 14 rebound double - double , while Russell amassed 19 points , seven assists and four rebounds . It 's rare to see this Lakers team hit on all cylinders like this , but it 's a good sight for Los Angeles fans . They 'll look to build off this rare win , when they take in the Houston Rockets on Thursday in their next scheduled game .
The Washington Wizards ( 17 - 6 ) defeated the Utah Jazz ( 6 - 18 ) 93 - 84 on Sunday .

The Wizards help the Jazz to 39 percent shooting while converting 49 percent of their own shots from the field to secure the win . Utah has lost 11 of their last 12 games . They were without Derrick Favors ( ankle ) on Sunday , but Favors is travelling with the team on their six - game road trip , indicating that he could return sooner than later . Sophomore center Rudy Gobert earned the first start of his career in Favors ' absence . Gobert put up seven points , nine rebounds and three blocks in 31 minutes . At 7 - 1 , he has the tools to be one of the best shot blockers in the league if given the minutes . The Jazz continue their road trip in New Orleans on Tuesday against the Pelicans .
The New Orleans Pelicans ( 18 - 28 ) defeated the Brooklyn Nets ( 12 - 35 ) 105 - 103 on Saturday thanks to Jrue Holiday 's late - second game - winner . This game had an exciting finish with both teams giving blows all the way down to the final whistle . Holiday hit a three - pointer with 10 seconds left to take a three - point lead , but Joe Johnson followed that with a game - tying three with six seconds left for the Nets . On the Pelicans ' next possession , Holiday fumbled the ball before regaining possession and hitting a wild fade away for the winning margin with one second left . The bench scoring was the big difference for New Orleans , as they got 55 bench points to the Nets 24 . Brooklyn did a great job of hanging around in this game , but just couldn’t prevail late . Brook Lopez carried the Nets , as he tallied 33 points , 10 rebounds , three steals and four blocks in the loss . Thaddeus Young also had a nice game , as he amassed 16 points , eight rebounds and four assists in the defeat . This gave them their 13th loss in their last 15 games and it doesn’t get much easier against the Detroit Pistons on Monday in their next game . This gives New Orleans seven wins in their last nine games and the “must - win” homestand is really helping this team back into the playoff hunt . Anthony Davis missed the last two games with a concussion , but played big here . While Davis started 0 - for - 9 from the field in the first half , he still finished with 20 points and 16 rebounds in 40 minutes of action . Holiday was great down the stretch , as he finished with 26 points and seven assists . Ryan Anderson also continued his recent hot stretch , as he accumulated 24 points , six rebounds and five assists in the win . Up next for New Orleans is the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday .
The Atlanta Hawks ( 34 - 28 ) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers ( 12 - 51 ) 106 - 77 on Friday . In what looked like a lopsided matchup on paper , proved to be one on the court . Atlanta used their defense to pull out the win , as they held the Lakers to 77 points on 34 percent shooting . The fastbreak differential was huge as well , with the Hawks getting 27 fastbreak points to the Lakers two . Despite barely clearing 100 points , Atlanta shot 54 percent from the field in the victory . Atlanta has been one of the best defenses in the league over recent weeks and absolutely shut down the Lakers in this game . No Hawks player played particularly well , but they got some great performances from their bench . Dennis Schroeder led the team with 16 points off the bench and Kris Humphries nearly double - doubled in his Atlanta debut . Kyle Korver was extremely efficient , as he scored 15 points , while going 5 - for - 6 from the field . It 's a good thing the starters got a nice rest here , as they play again on Saturday against the Los Angeles Clippers . Los Angeles has been playing more competitively recently , but this was a downright ugly performance . They were without Kobe Bryant , Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson though , so it needs to be taken with a grain of salt . D'Angelo Russell really struggled , as he went 3 - for - 16 from the field after averaging nearly 27 points a game across his last four games . Julius Randle was the only Laker who played well , as he double - doubled in a 16 - point , 10 - rebound game . On deck for the Lakers is a nightmare matchup against the Golden State Warriors on Sunday .
The Los Angeles Clippers ( 42 - 22 ) defeated the New York Knicks ( 27 - 40 ) 101 - 94 on Friday .

The key for the Clippers was their defense , as they held the Knicks to 41 percent shooting from the field and 20 percent shooting from three - point range . Los Angeles was great from long distance as well , as they went 13 - for - 29 in the win .

The Spurs were led by Tiago Splitter , who finished with 14 points ( 5 - 12 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) and four rebounds in just under 22 minutes .

He 's been very productive for the Spurs over his last three games , averaging 17 points over that span .

The Thunder rode a 35 - point first quarter to an early lead and never trailed in the final three quarters as the home squad shot the lights out . Oklahoma City shot a pristine 49 percent from the floor and 53 percent ( 9 - 17 ) from three - point land , an efficient attack that was too much for the Hawks to handle . The Hawks hit 10 threes of their own , but were manhandled on the boards , as the Thunder won the rebounding battle 52 - 34 . Kevin Durant notched a triple - double for the Thunder as he dropped 25 points , 12 rebounds and 10 assists on Atlanta . Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka scored 23 points each and both tallied double - doubles , as Westbrook distributed 10 assists and Ibaka pulled down 10 rebounds . Kent Bazemore did what he could off the bench to keep the Hawks in it , as he knocked down 22 points on a smooth 7 - 12 shooting night , including four three - pointers . Jeff Teague led Hawks starters with 18 points , while Al Horford suffered a terrible 3 - 14 shooting night and managed just nine points and seven rebounds . Paul Millsap also could n't get it going , as he managed only seven points on five field goal attempts over 33 minutes of action . The Hawks will face the Spurs on Saturday back in Atlanta in a marquee inter - conference matchup . The Thunder will go on the road to Utah for a Friday night game as they try to extend their winning streak to four .
The Toronto Raptors ( 46 - 21 ) took down the Indiana Pacers ( 36 - 32 ) in overtime on Thursday , winning 101 - 94 . Center Bismack Biyombo recorded a career - high and franchise - record 25 rebounds to lead the team to victory . Needless to say , Toronto was merciless on the glass , outrebounding Indiana 57 - 48 . While Biyombo was the game 's biggest story , shattering his personal rebounding record while also scoring 16 points on just six field goal attempts and recording a pair of blocks , All-Star Kyle Lowry also had a big night . Lowry scored 28 points and neared a triple - double , also recording eight rebounds and eight assists . Fellow All-Star guard DeMar DeRozan matched Lowry 's scoring while getting to the free - throw line 12 times . All in all it was a big night for the Raptors , who were able to walk away victorious despite an abysmal 36 percent shooting night . The team has surpassed all expectations , rivaling the Cleveland Cavaliers for the top of the Eastern Conference headed down the stretch . After Thursday 's win , Toronto sits just two games out of the number one spot . The Pacers , meanwhile , had an equally horrific shooting night , going just 39 percent from the field . Star Paul George led the way with 18 points and nine rebounds , but no one Pacer took over the game in the way Biyombo and the Raptors backcourt were able to . Guard Monta Ellis came up with four big steals and dished out seven assists , but shot just 3 - for - 11 on the night . The loss puts Indiana more firmly in the seventh slot in the Eastern Conference , and Thursday 's matchup looks as though it may be a playoff preview if seeding remains constant for the rest of the season . Toronto will host the ailing Boston Celtics on Friday , while Indiana will see the powerhouse Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday .
The Portland Trail Blazers ( 14 - 20 ) defeated the Denver Nuggets ( 12 - 21 ) 110 - 103 on Wednesday night . This win gave Portland their third - straight and they 've done that without Damian Lillard . The starters were the big difference in the game , as the Trail Blazers starting - five outscored Denver 's 76 - 53 . The Nuggets defense struggled yet again , as Portland shot nearly 50 percent from the field . The game was close throughout , but Portland continued to keep a distance from Denver and simply held them off til the final whistle . Denver is in the midst of a terrible slump right now , as this loss marks their seventh in their last eight games . It 's not just the defense that has slowed this team down , as both ends of the floor are a struggle right now . Much of that can be attributed to the injuries and it 's hard to imagine this team playing consistently until they are fully healthy . Will Barton played his homecoming game here and performed spectacularly , tallying 31 points , five rebounds and four assists in the defeat . Gary Harris also played well , as he scored 19 points and grabbed four rebounds . The good news is that Danilo Gallinari , Emmanuel Mudiay and Jusuf Nurkic are all due back to return within a week and this team will be greatly improved with those three starters back in the fold . The Nuggets wo n't play again until Saturday when they take on the Golden State Warriors in a game where they 'll surely be huge underdogs . The Blazers have been playing without Damian Lillard recently and playing well . He is unarguably the star of the team , but C.J . McCollum is doing a heck of a job controlling the offense in his absence . He had yet another great game here , as he contributed 29 points , three rebounds and four assists in the win . Allen Crabbe also had one of his best games of the season , as he scored 20 points and grabbed five boards . This young team is showing some promise and they should be an interesting team once Lillard returns . Portland 's next game will be on Thursday against the Utah Jazz .
The Portland Trail Blazers evened their Western Conference first - round playoff series against the visiting Los Angeles Clippers with a 98 - 84 win Monday in Game 4 at Moda Center . Al-Farouq Aminu picked a big game to step up , one that came against the Clippers team that drafted him and one that was needed for Portland to even the series . Aminu finished with 30 points in the contest , and at times looked like he would not miss a shot . Outside of Aminu , neither team played a pretty game of basketball , and the heavy blow to Chris Paul is leaving many Clippers fans in disbelief given their playoffs track record . Paul left the game after he fractured third metacarpal on his right hand according to Rowan Kavner of Clippers.com , but will undergo further tests when the team flies back to Los Angeles . J.J. Redick is dealing with a bruised heel and Blake Griffin briefly left the contest with soreness in his left quad . Coach Doc Rivers ' squad could not catch a break , and the injuries seemed to pile one on top of the other . Even with the unfortunate series of events , Los Angeles stayed competitive until the final five minutes of regulation . Damian Lillard and C.J . McCollum were unable to replicate their success in Game 3 , but still drained clutch shots in the fourth quarter . Lillard finished with 12 points , six rebounds , six assists and one steal on 4 - of - 15 shooting , while McCollum added 19 points . Maurice Harkless contributed 12 points and seven boards and Mason Plumlee played efficiently as a utility man , as he completed a double - double with 14 rebounds and 10 assists . Allen Crabbe went a perfect 5 - of - 5 from the field on his way to 12 points in 27 minutes off the bench . Prior to Paul leaving the game , he was the main difference maker for the Clippers success in the first half , as he was responsible for his team’s first 10 points on 5 - of - 5 shooting , but eventually cooled off and finished with 16 points , one rebound and four assists . Jeff Greene and Jamal Crawford aided the starters with a combined 29 points off the bench , while Griffin 17 points , seven rebounds and two assists on 6 - of - 15 shooting . Game 5 is Wednesday at Staples Center .
The San Antonio Spurs ( 27 - 16 ) defeated the Denver Nuggets ( 18 - 24 ) 109 - 99 on Tuesday at the Pepsi Center in Denver . Coming out of the third quarter up just 80 - 76 , the Spurs had a fantastic fourth quarter both offensively and defensively , out - scoring the Nuggets 29 - 23 to secure the 10 - point victory on the road . The Spurs were able to shoot 11 - for - 27 from the three - point line , while the Nuggets shot just 5 - of - 14 , which may have been the difference in this one . After playing in only 23 minutes during Sunday 's game against the Utah Jazz , Tony Parker returned to playing a full minutes load , finishing with a team - high of 18 points ( 8 - 16 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) , while also adding seven assists in 32 minutes . It did n't look as if he suffered any setbacks in the win , so hopefully he can continue to play without a minutes restriction moving forward . Kawhi Leonard had a very good showing . He went 6 - for - 13 from the field and 3 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score 17 points , while recording 15 rebounds . The double - double marked his seventh of the season . Tim Duncan reached double figures as well with 16 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) . He had a season - low of five rebounds , but the Spurs were still able to secure the win . Coming off the bench , Aron Baynes had his second successful night in a row . He went a perfect 3 - for - 3 from the field and 9 - for - 9 from the free throw line to score 15 points in only 15 minutes . In Sunday 's game he had 12 points and 11 rebounds , so he was able to stay hot in the victory . For the Nuggets , Kenneth Faried and Arron Afflalo did most of the damage against the Spurs . Faried finished with 26 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 8 - 12 FT ) and 14 rebounds , marking his first double - double in the last four games . He only scored a combined 13 points over his last two outings , so it was a huge bounce back game for him . Afflalo on the other hand shot 6 - for - 11 from the field and 3 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score 21 points , while adding three steals . He had only two points in Monday 's loss to the Warriors , so like Faried , it was good to see him turn things around . Rookie center Jusuf Nurkic nearly had a double - double of his own , finishing with 10 points and nine rebounds . He 's now averaging 7 points and 6 rebounds so far this season . The only other Nugget to reach double figures in points was Wilson Chandler who had 11 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 1 - 3 FT ) in 37 minutes . The Spurs ' next game will be on the road against the Chicago Bulls on Thursday , while the Nuggets will be at home against the Boston Celtics on Friday .
The San Antonio Spurs defeated the New York Knicks , 106 - 98 , at AT & T Center on Saturday . San Antonio were expected to win this game easily , but New York gave them a tough fight . It was a near wire - to - wire win for the Spurs though , as they held the lead for 47 minutes , with the Knicks one and only lead coming early in the first quarter . While San Antonio did n't dominate the statistics , they won nearly every one , winning the rebounding , assisting , steals , blocks , turnovers , fastbreak points and points in the paint differentials . Bench production was the only notable difference , with the Spurs scoring 37 bench points to the Knicks 13 . The Knicks ( 27 - 46 ) had a tough task here and nearly pulled out a huge upset win .

The Milwaukee Bucks ( 39 - 40 ) defeated the New York Knicks ( 15 - 64 ) 99 - 91 on Friday in New York . It was rough for the Bucks in the first half , as they found themselves down by as much as six to the NBA 's worst team . But they were able to kick it up a notch in the third quarter and outscore the Knicks by 13 in the period , and they were able to take care of business from there . Giannis Antetokounmpo was thrust back into the starting lineup after a DNP ( coach 's decision ) in Milwaukee 's last game , and he played very well , scoring 23 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 9 - 11 FT ) and grabbing nine rebounds in 31 minutes . Khris Middleton was not far behind , posting 22 points ( 9 - 16 FG , 3 - 6 3Pt ) , seven rebounds and he was very active defensively with six steals in 35 minutes . Michael Carter-Williams also continued his strong play as of late , scoring 19 points ( 8 - 13 FG ) , seven assists and four steals in 31 minutes . In his last two games , Carter-Williams has now combined for 49 points and 15 assists . As a team , the Bucks recorded an astounding 17 steals , and the victory keeps them in sixth place in the Eastern Conference . For now , they sit there comfortably with a two - game lead for that position with just three games remaining in the regular season . The dreadful season for the Knicks continues , as this loss is their 11th in their last 12 games . Langston Galloway was once again solid in the losing effort , scoring 20 points on 8 - of - 16 shooting in 35 minutes . Four other New York players scored in double figures , with Lance Thomas ( 16 ) , Shane Larkin ( 14 ) , Jason Smith ( 11 ) and Lou Amundson ( 10 ) rounding out the five total . Andrea Bargnani sat out this game with an illness . The Knicks recorded a dreadful 24 turnovers to just 22 assists , and they continue to boast the worst record in the NBA this season . Up next , the Bucks will head home Sunday to take on the Nets , while the Knicks will travel to Orlando Saturday to play the Magic .
The Milwaukee Bucks ( 25 - 35 ) defeated the visiting Houston Rockets ( 29 - 31 ) 128 - 121 , on Monday night at BMO Harris Bradley Center . The Rockets have been slouching lately as they barley hang on to the eight spot in the West . That trend continued Monday night as they trailed 32 - 26 after one quarter for the 10th straight game . Despite winning the last six match - ups versus Milwaukee , Houston came up short this time as the Bucks racked up a season - high 128 points behind huge nights from Jabari Parker , Khris Middleton and Giannis Antetokounmpo . This win snaps a two - game losing streak for the Bucks , while the Rockets fall to 2 - 6 in their last eight games . Jabari Parker led the Bucks in scoring with a career - high 36 points on 16 - 25 shooting from the field , along with five assists , four rebounds and two steals , in 40 minutes . Khris Middleton added a cool 30 points , in part thanks to perfect 15 - 15 shooting from the free throw line , while Giannis Antetokounmpo recorded the second triple - double of his career , with 18 points , 17 rebounds and 11 assists , along with four steals and two blocked shots , in 42 minutes .

The Rockets starters accounted for 99 of their points , with the bench chipping in only 22 . Although 121 points is usually enough to win an NBA game , Houston failed to record one blocked shot , allowing the Bucks to cruise to a season - high 128 points . Dwight Howard had a huge game with 30 points and 13 rebounds , in 35 minutes , while James Harden tagged along with 26 points , nine assists , six rebounds and three steals , in 40 minutes .

The Bucks will look to gain ground in the East as they host the Pacers on Wednesday .
The Los Angeles Lakers ( 11 - 41 ) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans ( 18 - 31 ) 99 - 96 on Thursday . Throughout the course of this , his final season , 20 - year - veteran Kobe Bryant has certainly had his ups and downs . He 's gone through long stretches where he 's struggled with his shot , and due to his generally unremarkable numbers , his election to the All-Star team has been derided by some as a somewhat undeserved distinction . However , over the last three contests , Bryant has turned back the clock and resembled the legendary figure that has earned the many accolades he 's received throughout his retirement tour . His remarkable run continued Thursday , with the 37 - year - old registering a team - high 27 points , and adding 12 boards , two assists and two steals in leading Los Angeles to only their fifth road victory of the season . The output followed a season - high 38 - point outburst against the Timberwolves on Tuesday , and a 23 - point effort in just 23 minutes against the Hornets last Sunday . The steady Jordan Clarkson followed Bryant 's performance with 18 points , five rebounds and two assists of his own . Julius Randle had a tough assignment against Anthony Davis , but did contribute 11 points , eight rebounds and three assists as the only other Lakers starter to post double - digit scoring . D'Angelo Russell stepped in off the bench to pace the reserves with 13 points , three rebounds and three assists , while Nick Young provided 11 points , four rebounds , an assist and a steal . The Lakers remain in last place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They head to San Antonio to take on the Spurs in a Saturday night showdown . Anthony Davis unsurprisingly dominated a vulernable Lakers frontcourt throughout the night , tallying 39 points , 11 rebounds , a steal and a block . Bryce Dejean-Jones , who has been a revelation during Eric Gordon 's absence due to a finger injury , pitched in with 17 points , nine rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals . His contributions were particularly relevant on a night when backcourt mate Norris Cole could only manage two points , two assists and two steals , and during which Davis was the only other starter to post double - digit points . Jrue Holiday was outstanding off the bench , supplying a near double - double in 34 minutes of action with 19 points , nine assists , a steal and a block . However , he missed an opportunity to send the game into overtime when he misfired on a 25 - foot three - point jumper at the buzzer . Ryan Anderson was n't far behind with a productive effort of his own , totaling 17 points and four rebounds . The Pelicans remain in last place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head to Cleveland to take on the Cavaliers on Saturday night .
Karl-Anthony Towns put up a monsterous stat line to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a three point victory over the Denver Nuggets .

Despite trailing by 10 points with 4:18 to go in the game , the Magic roared back to tie it at 12 - 102 with 2:15 to go , fueld by seven quick points from Tobias Harris . But Phoenix guard Eric Bledsoe was n't having it , as he scored the final five points for the Suns to seal the victory . Bledsoe and Brandon Knight each led the Suns with 21 points . Alex Len knocked down 20 points on a clean 7 - 10 shooting night , blocked three shots , and notched a double - double with 14 rebounds . Mirza Teletovic knocked down four of his eight three - pointers on what was an otherwise dreadful deep shooting night for the Suns ( 6 - 24 , 25 percent as a team on three - point shots ) , but their efficiency inside ( 35 - 56 , 63 percent ) was too tough for Orlando . Nikola Vucevic ( 8 - 16 shooting ) led the Magic with 21 points and 11 rebounds , and Elfrid Payton notched his own double - double with 12 points and 10 assists . It was a solid offensive night for Orlando , as they rained down 12 three - pointers on 25 attempts , but their inability to stop Phoenix inside - - the Suns retrieved 11 offensive rebounds - - finished them . Orlando will try to get back to winning ways Friday at home against Cleveland . Phoenix next faces the Trail Blazers at home Friday night .
The Phoenix Suns ( 22 - 16 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 5 - 29 ) 113 - 111 on Wednesday at the Target Center in Minneapolis .

The Suns had another strong showing from their backcourt of Eric Bledsoe and Goran Dragic . Dragic led the team with 25 points ( 11 - 16 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , while he also added three rebounds and four assists . He continues to have the slight lead over Bledsoe as the the team scoring leader at 17 points per game . Bledsoe had 17 points ( 7 - 17 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) of his own . He did a little bit of everything tonight , as he contributed five rebounds , seven assists and five steals as well . The five steals were a season - high for him , as he was a big reason for the large turnover differential . The Suns got a lot of production from their bench , with both Isaiah Thomas and Gerald Green reaching double figures in points . Thomas had 17 points ( 6 - 14 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and a season - high of five steals , while Green recorded 21 points ( 8 - 16 FG , 3 - 8 3pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and three rebounds . The Timberwolves were led by rookie Andrew Wiggins .

It was a big night for the Phoenix Suns , as the struggling team was able to earn an emphatic blowout win . Sophomore shooting guard Devin Booker scored a team - high 27 points on 10 - of - 19 shooting . Point guard Eric Bledsoe complemented his fellow guard 's play with 23 points and a team - high eight assists . Forward T.J. Warren shot 8 - of - 17 for 16 points , and big man Alan Williams recorded a double - double with 14 points and 11 rebounds off the bench . The team as a whole shot over 50 percent on the night and committed only eight turnovers . Chicago , meanwhile , shot only 43 percent . Superstar Jimmy Butler had 20 points and six assists but shot only 6 - of - 16 . Little offense was to be found outside of Butler and veteran Dwyane Wade , who scored 18 points on 7 - of - 16 shooting .
These are two teams going in opposite directions and a dominating Miami win shows just which way . The key for the Heat was their rebounding , as they won that battle , 51 - 40 . The assist margin really killed the Suns , as they committed 24 turnovers , while forcing just 15 from the Heat . Marquese Chriss led the Way for Phoenix , as he amassed 24 points and seven rebounds on 7 - of - 9 from the field . Alex Len recorded a double - double , totaling 12 points , 11 rebounds and four blocks . Hassan Whiteside was the player of the game , as he accrued 23 points , 14 rebounds , three steals and two blocks . Goran Dragic finished with 16 points , four rebounds , two assists and two steals .

The host Denver Nuggets cruised past the Brooklyn Nets on Friday , 129 - 109 . It was smooth sailing for Denver ( 26 - 32 ) , who earned a bounce - back win after falling to the Kings on Thursday night . Like Thursday night , however , star Denver center Nikola Jokic was a complete non - factor . The 21 - year - old played only 14 minutes and picked up four fouls while scoring only two points . A big night from Jokic was n't necessary for Denver 's success , though , as three Nuggets scored at least 20 points on the night . The team 's high - scorer was shooting guard Gary Harris , who posted 25 points . Overall , Denver shot a stellar 50 percent from the field including 14 three - pointers and held a nine - rebound advantage on the glass . Brooklyn ( 9 - 48 ) , meanwhile , appears far from getting back on track . While injuries to key players such as Jeremy Lin have played a role , the Nets have simply performed at a low level throughout the season . Brooklyn has now lost 15 consecutive games and remains significantly behind in the Eastern Conference standings . On Friday , the team saw a fairly respectable offensive night but a miserable defensive one . The Nets shot over 49 percent but were outscored by 20 . A big issue for Brooklyn was turnovers , as the team coughed the ball up 19 times on the night . The Nets will visit Golden State on Saturday , while Denver will host the Grizzlies on Sunday .
The visiting Boston Celtics defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves , 99 - 93 , at at Target Center on Monday . Enter the final period , the game was firmly in the Timberwolves ' ( 4 - 9 ) grasp , as they held a commanding 13 - point lead over the Celtics ( 8 - 6 ) entering the final period after winning both the second and third quarters . Boston , however , quickly changed that when they opened up the fourth quarter on a 170 run to take a four point lead . From there , the Timberwolves would never lead again as the Celtics ' Isaiah Thomas closed things out for his team by scoring 10 of their final 12 points . Thomas finished the outing with a game - high 29 points , while Al Horford posted 20 points , six rebounds , five assists and three blocks in 36 minutes . For the Timberwolves , Karl Anthony Towns was nearly unstoppable , shooting 11 - of - 19 from the field and 2 - of - 4 from behind the arc en route to scoring a team - high 27 points and grabbing 18 rebounds . Minnesota 's other star , Andrew Wiggins , struggled mightily Tuesday night , scoring 14 points in a very poor 5 - of - 18 shooting from the field . In the end , the Timberwolves lost the game because they were n't able to hit their outside shots , as Wiggins and shooting guard Zach LaVine combined to shoot 0 - of - 12 from 3 - point range , while as a team , Minnesota shot 4 - of - 20 from behind the arc . Up next , the Celtics will head to Brooklyn on Wednesday to play the Nets , while the Timberwolves will travel to New Orleans to take on the Pelicans on the same day .
It 's rare to see a home team so thoroughly dominated , but that was just the case here . In fact , the Thunder pulled out the wire - to - wire win , while holding a double - digit lead for the final 20 - plus minutes . Shooting was key , with Oklahoma City hitting 53 percent from the field and 56 percent from three , while Toronto shooting only 46 percent from the field and 26 percent from long range . The Thunder also took care of the rebounding , winning that battle , 47 - 32 . Russell Westbrook notched his 34th triple - double , as he accumulated 24 points , 10 rebounds and 16 assists . Victor Oladipo finished with 23 points and five rebounds . DeMar DeRozan was the lone bright spot for the Raptors , as he tallied 22 points , three rebounds and three assists . Norman Powell finished second on the team , providing 13 points and four rebounds .
The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 125 - 99 at Target Center on Sunday . At the beginning of the season , the Timberwolves were supposed to be the young surprise team in the league , but the Lakers have taken that crown thus far . That was n't the case here though , as Minnesota dominated throughout this game . Offense was key for the Timberwolves , as they shot 53 percent from the field and 48 percent from three - point range . The assist - to - turnover ratio was huge as well , with Los Angeles committing 17 turnovers to their 16 assists , while Minnesota committed just 10 turnovers to 28 assists . A 25 - 5 run in the second quarter is when the Timberwolves really pulled away , as the Lakers could n't recover after that . Los Angeles ( 6 - 5 ) had to play this game in the second half of a back - to - back set and it clearly slowed them down in this loss . The bench carried the load , as Jordan Clarkson , Brandon Ingram and Lou Williams all scored in double figures . Williams led the team in scoring , tallying 17 points , five rebounds and four assists . Julius Randle led the starters in scoring , dropping 14 points , six rebounds and three assists . Clarkson also scored 14 points on 6 - of - 10 shooting . Los Angeles will look to bounce back on Tuesday , when they host the Brooklyn Nets for their next game . Minnesota ( 3 - 6 ) has gotten off to a rough start this season , but dominating wins like this mean a lot going forward . Andrew Wiggins was the player of the game , as he tallied a career - high 47 points on 14 - of - 21 from the field and 17 - of - 22 from the free - throw line . Despite Karl-Anthony Towns going 7 - of - 22 from the field , he still finished with 22 points and 12 rebounds .

The Hornets were led by Kemba Walker , who continues to prove that Madison Square Garden is one of his favorite places to play . Walker tallied 31 points , four rebounds and three steals in the loss . After winning Player of the Week last week , Nicolas Batum started this week with a terrible game . Batum scored just four points on 1 - for - 9 shooting and provided just six rebounds and no other notable statistics , which is a bit strange for a player who regularly stuffs the stat sheet . The bench did play well for the Hornets though , as they had three players record at least 12 points and five rebounds in the defeat . Charlotte will look to bounce - back on Wednesday against the struggling Brooklyn Nets in the second half of a back - to - back for both teams .

They were led by rookie Kristaps Porzingis , who tallied a career - high 29 points and 11 rebounds in the win .

After being a terrible team last year , the Knicks have some fire this year and much of the success has to go to this talented rookie . New York was also led by another good performance from Carmelo Anthony , who collected 18 points , 11 rebounds and five assists in the victory .

The Knicks have a few days off until they play the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday in OKC in their next schedule game .

With President Barack Obama in town Tuesday to check in on his hometown team , the Bulls were able to come away with a victory on their home court , defeating the Cavaliers by a 97 - 95 count .

While their replacements in the lineup , Mo Williams ( 19 points , seven assists ) and J.R. Smith ( eight points , five boards , three assists ) had their moments , they couldn’t keep up with an effective Bulls attack .

Along with Rose , second - year man Nikola Mirotic drove the Chicago attack , piling up 19 points and nine rebounds .

The Washington Wizards ( 20 ) defeated the Toronto Raptors ( 0 - 2 ) , 117 - 106 , on Tuesday at the Air Canada Centre . The Wizards are the only team with a road win so far in this year 's postseason and now have a commanding 20 lead as the series heads back to Washington for Game 3 . Washington 's John Wall put together a stellar performance in Game 2 with 26 points and 17 assists . The Raptors trailed by double digits at the half , but cut the Wizards ' lead to just two points early in the third quarter . The Wizards responded by outscoring the Raptors 34 - 14 for the rest of the quarter to build a commanding lead . Toronto began to cut into the lead , but had trouble getting stops and were stuck trading baskets with Washington down the stretch . The Wizards have a chance to take a 30 advantage in the series on Friday in front of their home crowd . Washington flipped the script from Game 1 's defensive oriented win to light up the scoreboard in Game 2 to the tune of 117 points . The Wizards boosted their field goal percentage from 39 in Game 1 to 53 in Game 2 . In addition to Wall 's big outing , Bradley Beal was on fire with 28 points on 12 - for - 21 shooting . The Wizards are now positioned to close out this best of game series on their home floor with Games 3 and 4 at the Verizon Center . Toronto will have an uphill climb to get back into this series after dropping its first two games at home . That uphill climb is made tougher by the fact that star point guard Kyle Lowry is clearly less than 100 percent . Lowry finished with six points on 3 - of - 10 shooting in 27 minutes on the floor and did not play in the final 5:56 . He appeared to suffer a foot injury in the fourth and was hindered by a number of injuries down over the last month of the regular season .

The Houston Rockets defeated the visiting Phoenix Suns on Monday , 131 - 115 . Houston ( 23 - 9 ) has surprised many by holding the third - best record in the Western Conference over a third of the way through the season . On Monday , the Rockets looked as strong as ever , due in large part to the strong play of superstar James Harden . Harden predictably took over the game , scoring 32 points and dishing out 12 assists , both team highs . Sixth man Eric Gordon , meanwhile , continued to be a key part of the Rockets ' newfound high - paced offensive attack . Gordon had 15 points and hit three three - pointers . As a team , the Rockets had 15 three - pointers and shot an impressive 50 percent from the field . Phoenix ( 9 - 22 ) , on the other hand , sits near the bottom of the Western Conference for the second straight season . The Suns have won just three of their last eight contests . On Monday , Phoenix started the game off by accumulating a huge deficit , trailing 39 - 23 by the end of the first quarter .

The Rockets will visit Dallas on Tuesday , while the Suns will travel to San Antonio on Wednesday .
The Indiana Pacers ( 10 - 5 ) beat the Chicago Bulls ( 9 - 5 ) 104 - 92 on Friday . The Bulls have earned had a reputation as a gritty , blue - collar team that tends to dominate in the paint , with rebounders such as Pau Gasol and Joakim Noah often leading the way . However , the Indiana Pacers ' performance Friday may be indicative of a changing of the guard in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division , where both teams reside . The home team largely controlled matters down low , hauling in a collective 51 boards and scoring 42 of their 104 points in the paint , as compared to 28 for the Bulls . Point guard George Hill and reserve forward Lavoy Allen surprisingly spearheaded the Pacers ' rebounding efforts with 10 apiece , and Ian Mahinmi ( 9 ) and Paul George ( 8 ) pitched in with strong board totals as well . Indiana 's frontcourt had been particularly maligned early in the season , but Mahinmi appears to be settling in nicely as the unquestioned starting center , and players like Allen and George have been making consistently strong contributions around the basket as well . Hill could only muster six points to go along with the 10 rebounds , but others picked up the slack scoring - wise . George followed up a 40 - point outburst versus Washington on Tuesday with a 33 - point effort , while C.J . Miles continued his string of strong offensive showings with 16 points . Mahinmi and Monta Ellis rounded out a strong night for Indiana 's starting five with 15 and 14 points , respectively . Allen poured in 12 to pace the Pacers ' bench and tally his first double - double of the season . The Pacers improved to 10 - 5 and currently reside in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They head to Los Angeles to face off against the Lakers on Sunday . The Bulls were lead by Nikola Mirotic , who totaled a season - high 25 points to go along with seven rebounds , two assists and a block . Jimmy Butler ( 16 points , five rebounds , five assists , two steals and two blocks ) and Derrick Rose ( 10 points , six rebounds , five assists , a steal and a block ) were the only other Chicago starters to manage double - digit scoring . Notably , Gasol totaled only nine points , marking his third single - digit scoring night of the season . He did manage 11 boards , giving him double - digit rebounds in five of his last six outings . Kirk Hinrich led the reserves with 11 points over 22 minutes . Chicago fell to 9 - 5 and currently resides in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They head home for a date with the Spurs on Monday .
Milwaukee 's stifling defense held the Bulls to a season - low scoring total , while also limiting them to a 30 percent success rate from the field . Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way with a 22 - point , 11 - assist double - double , while Jabari Parker managed 12 points . John Henson and Tony Snell posted a pair of 10 - point efforts , and Greg Monroe came off the bench to tally a 14 - point , 12 - rebound double - double over 23 minutes . A nightmarish outing for the Bulls saw Dwyane Wade pace them in scoring with a modest 12 points , while Taj Gibson and Robin Lopez posted a pair of eight - point tallies on a combined 7 - of - 20 shooting . Jimmy Butler and Rajon Rondo had matching seven - point contributions . Bobby Portis actually served as the second - leading scorer on the team despite coming off the bench , posting 10 points and eight rebounds in 19 minutes .
The Atlanta Hawks ( 5 - 3 ) defeated the Miami Heat ( 5 - 4 ) 114 - 103 on Friday . Atlanta has won four straight games , and they 've been without starting small forward DeMarre Carroll ( groin ) for the last two games . Thabo Sefolosha has been filling in admirably in Carroll 's stead . Sefolosha finished with 12 points Friday . He was one of eight Hawks players to finish with double - digit points . Miami is on a two - game losing streak , but their struggles against the Hawks were explainable with Dwyane Wade sitting out with a minor hamstring injury . James Ennis received the spot start in place of Wade , but it was Mario Chalmers off the bench who showed up big . He had a double - double with a team - high 23 points and 11 assists in 40 mintues . Wade is questionable to play in the Heat 's next game Sunday at home against the Milwaukee Bucks . The Hawks will finish off their back - to - back set Saturday in Cleveland against the Cavaliers .
The San Antonio Spurs ( 29 - 6 ) continued their undefeated streak at home Saturday by beating the Houston Rockets ( 16 - 19 ) , 121 - 103 . The Rockets pulled off the unlikely task of beating the Spurs in their last meeting on Christmas , but this one followed a much more common script . San Antonio ran away with a dominating victory and really took it to the Rockets . It was a 31 - 7 run in the third quarter that really put some distance between these teams and Houston could never recover after that . San Antonio killed Houston with their own recipe , by hitting 13 - of - 24 three - pointers en route to the blowout . Houston 's defense has really let them down all year and that was the case yet again here . They allowed the Spurs to shoot over 52 percent from the field and allowed far too many open threes . Most of the starters struggled aside from James Harden and Dwight Howard . The 17 points that Harden scored is extremely low for him , and he really didn’t make any sort of impact in the second half . Howard did record a double - double though , as he collected 22 points and 12 rebounds in the defeat . Houston was expected to lose this game , but the fashion they did it in was ugly yet again and one has to wonder if big changes are coming . The Rockets will look to bounce back on Monday against the Utah Jazz . San Antonio has been dominating with their defense this season , but the offense carried them tonight . They rank first in every significant defensive statistic , but also rank third in offensive efficiency . They surely added to that efficiency rating here , as they shot over 50 percent from the field and three - point range while dishing out an impressive 31 assists . Boris Diaw was the star of the show off the bench , as he tallied 20 points and eight boards in just 25 minutes of action . Danny Green also hit a season - high six three 's en route to an 18 - point outing with a solid all - around line . San Antonio has now won 20 - straight home games and they are truly one of the best teams in basketball right now . They 'll play the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday in their next scheduled game .
The Phoenix Suns ( 20 ) defeated the San Antonio Spurs ( 1 - 1 ) 94 - 89 on Friday . Kawhi Leonard returned to the active lineup for the Spurs after missing extended time with an eye infection . He started at small forward and played 24 minutes . With Tiago Splitter ( back/calf ) still sidelined , Austin Daye was given a spot start at power forward to matchup with the Suns ' small - ball power forward Markieff Morris . Daye played 19 minutes and finished with six points . Matt Bonner , who started the Spurs ' opener at center did not get off the bench against the Suns . Alex Len played a career - high 32 minutes and finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds to record the first double - double of his NBA career . Len did his damage off the bench , while starting center Miles Plumlee played just 15 minutes , a development that does n't mean much in the course of one game , but after the Suns invested a fifth - overall pick in the 2013 NBA Draft on Len , his development is something they 're going to be keen to push , and that may come at the expense of Plumlee at some point . Isaiah Thomas lead the Suns with a team - high 23 points off the bench . The Spurs have four days off before their next game at home Wednesday against the Atlanta Hawks . The Suns will finish a back - to - back set on the road Saturday against the Utah Jazz .
When Portland took a 21 - point lead headed into the half , this game appeared to be over . The Wizards had other ideas though , as they sent this game into overtime , with Markieff Morris hitting a game - winner with 0 seconds left to seal the comeback victory .

The Oklahoma City Thunder ( 36 - 13 ) defeated the Houston Rockets ( 25 - 24 ) 116 - 108 on Friday . The showdown between two of the most high - powered offenses in the Western Conference lived up to its billing , with the respective stars on both teams playing an integral part in lighting up the scoreboard . The Rockets held a 58 - 55 lead at intermission , and were scoring with relative ease throughout the first two quarters . However , the Thunder made a concerted effort to clamp down in the second half , a strategy that was largely effective as evidenced by the 38 and 23 percent tallies from the field and three - point range , respectively , that the visitors finished with . The home team also played much more efficiently around the basket , outrebounding Houston 57 to 40 and outscoring them in the paint , 58 - 50 . Even after Houston 's 80 run cut the Thunder lead to 112 - 106 with 1:20 remaining , Oklahoma City insured that matters would end there by pressing James Harden on his last - gasp , 14 - foot step - back jump shot with 17 seconds remaining and grabbing the subsequent rebound . The Rockets were led by Harden 's 33 points , seven rebounds , seven assists , two steals and a block . Corey Brewer was next , registering 17 points , two rebounds , an assist and a block . Although the remaining three starters could only tally single - digit point totals , they made important contributions across the stat sheet . Trevor Ariza managed eight points , six rebounds , five assists , five steals and a block . Dwight Howard tallied eight points and eight rebounds , along with an assist and a pair of steals . However , he was only four of 15 from the free - throw line , and was ejected after amassing two technicals .

The Thunder received a pair of outstanding performances from the dynamic duo of Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant . Durant led the team with 33 points , and added 12 rebounds , three assists , a steal and a block . He also had played some solid defense in the second half to help lead the comeback . Westbrook chimed in with a triple - double , amassing 26 points , 14 assists , 10 rebounds , a steal and a block . Enes Kanter was highly efficient off the bench , amassing 22 points , 10 boards , a pair of steals and a block . He notably tallied 12 of his points in the final period , and hauled in the aforementioned final rebound off Harden 's miss . Dion Waiters was the only other Thunder player , starter or reserve , to manage double - digit scoring . He collected 16 points and added two rebounds and a steal . The Thunder remain atop the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They face off with the Wizards at home on Monday .
The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Dallas Mavericks 121 - 118 Wednesday at Smoothie King Center . After missing the last two games with an ankle sprain , DeMarcus Cousins returned in a dominant fashion , as the tandem of he and Anthony Davis were nearly unstoppable in the Pelicans ' ( 31 - 43 ) victory Wednesday night . Cousins scored 29 points and grabbed a game - high 16 rebounds while Davis still managed to score a game - high 30 points and grab 13 rebounds of his own . Together , the duo shot 50 percent from the field and an impressive 18 - of - 20 ( 90 percent ) from the free throw line . As a team , New Orleans shot 51 percent from the field and a 40 percent from behind the arc , and they needed every one of those shots to fall as the Mavericks ( 31 - 43 ) simply would n't go away . Five different Dallas players scored in double figures in the losing effort , with Dirk Nowitzki leading the way with 23 points on 7 - of - 14 shooting and seven rebounds in 31 minutes . And overall , it was actually a very impressive offensive performance for the Mavericks , as the team shot 48 percent from the field and a scorching 52 percent from behind the arc . In the end , however , the team was just unable to overcome the 12 - point lead the Pelicans took into halftime of Wednesday 's contest . Up next , the Pelicans will remain home Friday to take on the Kings , while the Mavericks will head to Memphis on Friday to play the Grizzlies .
The Golden State Warriors ( 54 - 13 ) defeated the Atlanta Hawks ( 53 - 15 ) 114 - 95 on Wednesday at Oracle Arena in Oakland . After suffering a 124 - 116 loss to the Hawks back in February , the Warriors got plenty of revenge Wednesday , finishing with a convincing 19 - point victory over the Hawks . The Hawks winning streak ends at three , but they still sit with a hefty 10 - game lead over the Cavaliers for the top spot in the Eastern Conference standings . The Warriors , on the other hand , have extended their own winning streak to three games , while pushing their Western Conference standings lead to seven and a half games over the Memphis Grizzlies .

It was a new season - high in points for Barnes , as he 's only surpassed the 20 - point mark in two other games this season .

We ca n't leave out superstar Stephen Curry though , as he posted 16 points ( 4 - 11 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 6 - 6 FT ) and 12 assists in 30 minutes . Even without backcourt parnter Klay Thompson ( ankle ) , Curry got some help from the rest of the team , as everyone seemed to step up . Draymond Green added 18 points ( 6 - 11 FG , 5 - 7 3Pt , 1 - 4 FT ) and seven rebounds as well . The Hawks just could n't keep up with the red - hot Warriors .

Kyle Lowry and Jonas Valanciunas spearheaded Toronto 's attack early , as Indiana continued to show a particular inability to control the latter down low .

The Golden State Warriors defeated the Orlando Magic , 118 - 98 , at Amway Center on Sunday afternoon . The Warriors ( 38 - 6 ) are particularly renowned for being lethal within the friendly confines of Oracle Arena , which often overshadows their considerable potency on the road . That was on full display Sunday , as the Splash Bros. made a rather spectacular appearance in Central Florida . Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson each drained seven three - pointers - - becoming the only pair of teammates in NBA history to accomplish the feat in the same game more than once - - on the way to respective totals of 27 and 21 points , spearheading a rather comfortable victory .

Jeff Green and Bismack Biyombo led the reserves with matching 12 - point tallies , with the latter also notably bringing down 14 rebounds and posting a trio of blocks .

The Oklahoma City Thunder blew by the Golden State Warriors at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday Night , 133 - 105 , to take a 2 - 1 series lead in the Western Conference finals . It was a big night for the dynamic duo of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook , as the pair combined for 63 points and 16 rebounds . Westbrook neared triple - double territory , recording 30 points , 12 assists , and eight rebounds . Durant , meanwhile , posted one of the most efficient individual performances of the playoffs , going 10 - for - 15 from the field and hitting all 12 of his free - throw attempts . The win was a top - to - bottom team effort , however , as the Thunder were able to score 72 first half points and establish a 25 - point lead by the end of the second quarter . OKC also dominated on the glass , where the team held a 52 - 38 rebounding advantage . Overall , it was an emphatic victory for the Thunder to begin their two - game home stand .

All-Star and Defensive Player of the Year runner - up Draymond Green had an even tougher time on Sunday night , going just 1 - for - 9 from the field , turning the ball over four times , and finishing with a team - worst plus/minus of - 43 . Green also stirred controversy in the first half after being called for a flagarant 1 on OKC center Steven Adams . Green appeared to kick Adams in the groin in a fashion similar to that of Cleveland guard Dahntay Jones , who was suspended for an almost identical infraction in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals . Golden State struggled on the defensive end as a team all night , allowing the Thunder to shoot 50 percent from the field and record a whopping 133 points on the night . Game 4 will take place on Tuesday night , as Oklahoma City looks to take a 3 - 1 lead before hitting the road again .

They did n't sell the Pistons any buckets . Detroit has lost 13 straight games in what has been a nightmarish start to the season . Coach Stan Van Gundy has tried to be patient with his rotations and starting lineup , but the players have n't rewarded him with much in the win column . Greg Monroe 's 22 - point , 10 - rebound double - double in 33 minutes off the bench was the only bright spot from the Pistons . They could have Jodie Meeks ( back ) make his season debut in Friday 's game , and it 'll be interesting to see if a single role player can help them dig out of the hole they 've dug .

Sixth man James Johnson came off the bench for 24 points , seven rebounds , and five assists .
The New York Knicks ( 8 - 6 ) beat the Houston Rockets ( 5 - 9 ) 107 - 102 on Saturday . Coming into the 2015 - 2016 NBA season , Kristaps Porzingis was looked at as a major work in progress , but the result of the No . 4 overall pick has given the Knicks fans something to really cheer for . Porzingis finished the night with 24 points , 14 rebounds and seven block on 8 - of - 12 shooting , including two 3 - pointers and a perfect 6 - of - 6 from the free throw line . Arron Afflalo has made a meaningful impact in his return to the starting lineup over the past few games , helping out from the 3 - point line as well , as he drained four 3 - pointers from deep in the effort . Carmelo Anthony was efficient in his 24 minutes played , scoring 14 points on 5 - of - 10 from the field , including a layup with 0:39 left in the 4th quarter which extended the Knicks lead by three . Six Houston Rockets’ finished in double figures , but it was not enough to win in front of their hometown crowd . James Harden led the way for Houston , finishing with 24 points , seven rebounds and 10 assists on 8 - for - 20 shooting . Harden , who finished second overall in the MVP voting last season , is struggling with efficiency from the floor , shooting 38 percent overall . Trevor Ariza , Terrence Jones , Clint Capela , Jason Terry and Marcus Thornton rounded out the rest of the Rockets in double figures , but the all around effort was not enough to secure a win . Houston recently fired head coach Kevin McHale with interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff . The Rockets defensive efficiency ranks in the lower third of the league , and letting up 107 points to the Knicks will not help that cause going forward . Houston will look to bounce back against the Memphis Grizzlies ( 7 - 7 ) at home on Wednesday , while the Knicks visit the Miami Heat ( 8 - 4 ) on Monday .
Goran Dragic was sensational in the Heat 's two - point win Monday over the Timberwolves , and with that effort , it looks as if the point guard is returning to the form of the All-NBA player he was back in 2014 . Dragic scored a team - high 33 points and dished out nine assists in 35 minutes against Minnesota , but what was most impressive was his shooting performance , as the Yugoslavian hit 7 - of - 9 shots from behind the arc and 13 - of - 17 shots from the field overall . And this is starting to become a more regular occurrence for Dragic , as following Monday 's performance , he has now shot at least 55 percent from the field in five of his last six contests , and he is shooting 60 percent from the field and an absurd 75 percent from three - point range . But on top of all the scoring , Dragic has remained a playmaker , dishing out 8 assists per game over that same stretch .
The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Chicago Bulls , 101 - 91 , at United Center on Saturday night .

It was the second and third quarters that made a difference , as Toronto outscored Milwaukee 59 to 38 in that stretch . The rebounding was a huge difference , with the Raptors bringing down 48 rebounds to the Bucks 37 . The three - point shooting was a factor as well , with Milwaukee shooting 15 percent , while Toronto shot over 48 percent .

Thomas Robinson and Jerami Grant were able to make positive contributions in their reserve roles , scoring 12 and 10 points respectively . The win is just Philadelphia 's third in 10 games , and they currently boast the third worst record in the NBA . It was a quick fall back to reality for the Pistons , as just a day after upsetting the Grizzlies and ending a 10 - game losing streak , they lost to one of the NBA 's worst teams . They were without Greg Monroe , who sat out his second consecutive game with a strained knee . Despite the loss , Detroit did have some strong performances .

Game 5 is scheduled for Tuesday , with tip - off coming at 9:30 p.m. EST .
The Memphis Grizzlies ( 13 - 10 ) defeated the Detroit Pistons ( 12 - 11 ) Wednesday 93 - 92 at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Detroit . The Pistons thought they had this game won .

He 's now combined for 47 points in the last two games , as he has found his shooting stroke as of late . O.J . Mayo was in the starting lineup at shooting guard for the first time this season . He capitalized on his opportunity as he shot 5 - for - 10 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 17 points .

The Chicago Bulls ( 25 - 10 ) fended off the Houston Rockets ( 23 - 11 ) , 114 - 105 , at the United Center on Monday evening . Entering the fourth quarter with a six - point deficit facing them , the Bulls whittled away at the Rockets ' lead and finally knotted up the score at 100 with just under three minutes remaining .

The Detroit Pistons ( 19 - 17 ) defeated the Orlando Magic ( 19 - 16 ) 115 - 89 on Monday night . Despite Detroit winning every quarter , this game was tight until the fourth quarter .

Rebounding has been key for the Pistons all season and that won them the game here , as the snatched down 54 boards to the Magic 's 30 . The starters were a key as well , as Detroit 's starters scored 75 points to Orlando 's 47 . That now makes Detroit 12 - 5 at the Palace and they 're becoming one of the best home teams in the NBA .

What was so great about this win was the performance of Brandon Jennings . This is just Jennings fourth game of the year after suffering a torn Achilles last season and he was spectacular , scoring 17 points and dishing out seven assists in just 18 minutes . It will be interesting to see what Stan Van Gundy does with this rotation with the breakout play of Reggie Jackson and the resurgence of Jennings . All five starters scored in double - figures here , despite having their minutes limited in the blowout . Andre Drummond also put in a 17 - point double - double and would have approached yet another 20 - 20 game if this fixture didn’t get so out of hand late . Detroit 's next game will be on the road on Wednesday against the Boston Celtics .
The Orlando Magic defeated the Sacramento Kings , 102 - 94 , at Amway Center on Thursday . The blueprints of the Magic ( 2 - 3 ) and Kings ( 2 - 4 ) were both on display Thursday , and Orlando showed why it 's sometimes better to have a collection of above - average players than a top - heavy attack heavily focused on one superstar talent . The Magic received a standout performance from Evan Fournier , who tallied a season - high 29 points , as well as double - digit scoring efforts from three other members of the first unit , and a double - digit assist performance from the one member of the group who did n't get there , Elfrid Payton . Meanwhile , the Kings received the lights - out production they are used to seeing from DeMarcus Cousins , while the rest of the starters struggled to maintain consistency through four quarters . The imbalance partially led to Sacramento progressively losing steam after winning the first period by a 29 - 23 margin , and despite a third - quarter resurgence , they produced only 16 points in the 12 minutes to fall short . Cousins ' final line consisted of 33 points , seven rebounds , four assists , two steals and a block . Rudy Gay was the next closest in terms of usage and scoring , tallying 16 points but adding only two rebounds , two assists and a steal .

Fournier complemented his team - high scoring haul with an assist and a rebound . Serge Ibaka continued his recent stretch of solid play with 17 points , three boards and a block while frequently dealing with Cousins down low .

Sacramento now heads to the Midwest for a showdown with the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday , while the Magic await the Washington Wizards for a Saturday night tussle .
The Detroit Pistons defeated the Atlanta Hawks , 121 - 85 , at Phillips Arena on Friday . The Pistons ( 11 - 10 ) endured their share of offensive struggles in the early going of the season , including a recent stretch where they failed to hit the 100 - point mark in four of six contests . However , they 've certainly gotten the hot hand over the last three contests , posting 112 points three games ago and a pair of 121 - point tallies in the two subsequent games . They were at it again Friday against a normally stingy Hawks defense , reaching the 121 - point milestone for a third straight outing while being led by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope . The talented two - guard posted 23 points , which included a 5 - of - 8 mark from beyond the arc , along with eight rebounds and a steal .

Jon Leuer continued his strong work off the bench with a near double - double of his own , totaling 16 points , nine rebounds , two assists and a steal . Beno Udrih and Darrun Hilliard also contributed a pair of 11 - point efforts in a reserve role . Dennis Schroder was the only member of the starting five for the Hawks ( 10 - 10 ) to manage double - digit scoring , posting 17 points , 11 assists and a pair of rebounds . Kent Bazemore and Kyle Korver totaled only 14 points between them , Thabo Sefolosha was in the starting lineup again with Paul Millsap sitting out with a hip injury , but he was only able to supply five points , two rebounds and a steal . Dwight Howard was particularly ineffective , totaling only two points , six rebounds and two blocks over 25 minutes . The second unit saw some more run than usual due to the blowout loss , and three bench players got into double digits in the scoring column . Mike Muscala 's and Tim Hardaway 's pair of 11 - point efforts led the way , while Kris Humphries followed closely behind with 10 . The Pistons return home to face the Orlando Magic on Sunday , while the Hawks head north of the border to face the Toronto Raptors on Saturday night .
The Boston Celtics dominated the visiting New York Knicks , 115 - 87 , on Friday night at TD Garden .

Isaiah Thomas was huge for Boston ( 4 - 4 ) as he led the way offensively with 29 points on 9 - of - 17 shooting , in only 28 minutes .

Kelly Olynyk was solid in his second game back , with 19 points on 6 - of - 11 shooting , seven rebounds and three assists , in 30 minutes . Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart both filled the stat sheet . Smart finished with 12 points , 10 assists , six rebounds and three steals , while Bradley notched 15 points , 10 rebounds , two assists and four steals . The Celtics move to 3 - 1 at home and will head out for a two - game road trip beginning in Indiana on Saturday . With this loss the Knicks ( 3 - 5 ) fall to 1 - 3 on the road and have not achieved consecutive wins once yet this season . They were coming off a good win in Brooklyn but failed to carry that momentum into this one , which may have had something to do with the fact that Carmelo Anthony was ejected mid - second quarter . Anthony scored 12 points in 12 minutes before losing his temper . Kristaps Porzingis was the high - point man with 14 points , along with six rebounds and two blocks , in 23 minutes . Derrick Rose added 11 points , six assists and four rebounds , while the only other player to tally double - digits for the Knicks was Justin Holiday , with 10 . The Knicks can only look ahead , where they have to bring their best effort to Toronto for their second game in as many nights Saturday .

The Hornets shot 45 percent from behind the arc , but even Walker 's heroics at the end of the fourth quarter were not enough to come away with the win .

Typically , it 's Damian Lillard who spearheads the Blazers ' attack , frequently leading Portland ( 4 - 3 ) in both field - goal attempts and scoring . However , it was backcourt mate C.J . McCollum who took the mantle Sunday , putting up more than double the shots of Lillard and leading all scorers with a season - high 37 points . The third - year shooting guard added four rebounds , two assists , a steal and a block over a team - high 39 minutes . McCollum also drained half of his 12 three - point attempts on the afternoon , after having made the same amount in the last three games combined .

Unfortunately for the Grizzlies , they were unable to have the same kind of shooting success Friday night , as they shot just 37 percent from the field and 25 percent from three . It was their free throw shooting that kept them in the game , as they went 23 - of - 30 from the charity stripe , but that ultimately was not enough .

In a game New Orleans needed to win to avoid a 0 - 3 deficit in its series with Golden State , the Pelicans looked to be on their way to delivering a victory in front of the home crowd . The Pelicans took a 20 - point lead into the fourth quarter , but the Warriors remained composed and began chipping into the deficit . Golden State 's Draymond Green , who got into foul trouble early , helped give the Warriors life with four offensive rebounds in the fourth quarter . That ability to extend possessions keyed Golden State 's comeback as the lead was cut to five with under a minute remaining . What was once an relaxed crowd at the Smoothie King Center turned tense with every missed shot by the Pelicans and every made basket by the Warriors . With time winding down and the Warriors down by just three points after an Anthony Davis missed free throw , Stephen Curry buried an unbelievable three pointer from the corner to send it to overtime . Curry then opened overtime with another three . Golden State took a six point lead , but New Orleans ' Ryan Anderson drained a three of his own to cut the lead to one . The Pelicans had one last good chance to tie the game late , but Anthony Davis ' layup attempt did n't fall as Golden State finished one of the biggest comebacks in playoff history .

The Golden State Warriors ( 120 ) defeated the Toronto Raptors ( 7 - 5 ) 115 - 110 on Tuesday . In a matchup of two of the best defenses in basketball , this was a high - scoring game . What may have ultimately killed the Raptors was a nine - minute stretch in the fourth quarter where they failed to make a basket . That stat is a bit flukey though , considering the Raptors got to the free - throw line time after time in the final 12 minutes . This Toronto team has struggled with assists all season long and that may have been the difference here , as the Warriors out - assisted the Raptors 31 - 18 . The win makes the Warriors the 17th team in NBA history to start 120 to start a season . The Warriors were once again led by Steph Curry , who tallied 37 points and nine assists in the win .

The Warriors also got a 19 - point first half from Klay Thompson , but he failed to score a point in the second half . Golden State shot an impressive 54 percent from the field , but did commit 20 turnovers in the win . It was n't the Warriors cleanest performance , but a win is a win . They 'll look to stay undefeated when they play the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday in a big rivalry game . The Raptors left it all on the floor against the defending champs , but just couldn’t pull it out late . Ten of Toronto 's 22 fourth quarter points came from the free - throw line and they simply didn’t make enough shots down the stretch to get the win in this game . They were once again led by their guards though , as DeMar DeRozan , Kyle Lowry and Cory Joseph all had nice games . The three actually combined for 69 points , 16 rebounds , 15 assists and four steals in the loss . Toronto also got six steals from DeMarre Carroll , who continued to read Steph Curry 's passes all evening long . The Raptors have now lost five of their last seven games with the only two wins coming against the Philadelphia 76ers and New Orleans Pelicans , who have a combined 1 - 21 record . They 'll have a tough task on Wednesday , as they have to travel to Utah to take on the defensively - sound Jazz in the second half of a back - to - back set .
In a close contest , the Chicago Bulls ( 38 - 37 ) earned a much - needed 103 - 100 win against the host Houston Rockets ( 37 - 39 ) .

Bench big man Nikola Mirotic , meanwhile , exploded for 28 points in what proved to be a valuable contribution to Chicago 's winning effort . Chicago 's stellar 48 percent from the field was a key factor in establishing a lead at the game 's end . Houston , meanwhile , sits just half a game out of playoff contention despite the loss . After making last year 's Western Conference Finals , the Rockets have seen a tremendous drop - off , now sitting below .500 . On Thursday , the backcourt of Patrick Beverly and James Harden combined for 46 points . Beverly also notched seven assists without a single turnover in one of his biggest performances of the season . It was n't enough for the win , however , as the team shot a dismal 40 percent from the field as a whole . With the season entering its final stretch , it will take some winning basketball to get Houston back on track for the playoffs . The Bulls will play the Pistons on Sunday , while the Rockets will take on the Thunder on Monday .

Stephenson scored just seven points ( 3 - 8 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) to go with four rebounds and two assists in only 25 minutes . It was the combo of Al Jefferson ( 28 points and 10 rebounds ) and Kemba Walker ( 27 points and seven assists ) that led the way , but they still fell short .

The Orlando Magic defeated the host Miami Heat , 136 - 130 , in double - overtime at American Airlines Arena on Tuesday .
