Utah also combined for 23 blocks and steals in the game and that 's one of the highest totals of the season . This gives Milwaukee their fifth - straight loss and it was an extremely tough night on the offensive end . No player scored more than 18 points in the loss with the five starters combining for 18 turnovers . Khris Middleton 's 18 points , six rebounds and three steals look good , but considering he shot 6 - for - 16 and committed nine turnovers , it was actually very ugly .

The Golden State Warriors ( 30 ) defeated the Houston Rockets ( 0 - 3 ) 115 - 80 , in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals . Shooting mastermind , Stephen Curry dropped a legendary performance on the Rockets with 40 points in 35 minutes . He hit seven of his nine attempts from beyond the arc and also filled up the stat sheet with seven assists , five rebounds , two steals and one block .

Bogut had 12 points , 12 rebounds and a block in 20 minutes of action , before fouling out . Golden State put it on the Rockets early and often . They led by 25 at halftime and Houston was unable to mount any sort of comeback . Draymond Green was a force to be reckoned with and Houston had no answer for him and Curry . Green had 17 points of his own to go along with a team - high 13 rebounds . The Rockets laid a dud at home in Game 3 and have now put themselves in a situation where they would need to win four straight games to advance to the NBA Finals . A feat that no team has ever accomplished after losing the first three games of the series . James Harden could n't find the magic that helped him finish second in the regular - season MVP award voting . He did a great job getting to the line as he usually does , going 10 - for - 11 from the charity stripe . However , he went just 3 - for - 16 from the field and could n't find his mojo . If the Rockets want to be the 2004 Red Sox of the NBA , they will need immaculate performances from their key players for four straight games . Golden State has n't lost three - straight games all season long , let alone four . Houston will host the Warriors in Game 4 on Monday .
DeMar DeRozan has been scoring at will this season and he added yet another 30 - point outing to his tally . He has now scored 30 or more points in 10 - of - 12 games this season and is only the fifth player in the past 54 years to set that mark . Strangely , the Nuggets won many of the statistical categories , as they took the rebounding , assisting , shooting percentage , points off turnovers and free - trow shooting battles in their defeat . Emmanuel Mudiay had one of his best games of the season though , as he tallied 25 points , six rebounds and nine assists . Wilson Chandler continues to dominate off the bench , as his 25 points and 10 rebounds add to his averages of 24 points and 9 rebounds over his last three games . Danilo Gallinari had a strange line , as he scored 21 points on 4 - of - 13 shooting . It was his 13 - of - 13 night from the free - throw line that got him up to that total , as he went 0 - of - 5 from long distance .
The Golden State Warriors ( 33 - 2 ) rolled over the Los Angeles Lakers ( 8 - 28 ) 109 - 88 on Tuesday night .

The starters for the Warriors dominated in the first and third quarters , as they outscored the Lakers 67 - 38 in that 24 - minute stretch . Usually the Warriors win by outscoring teams , but they played some of their best defense of the season here . The Lakers shot just 32 percent from the field and 24 percent from long distance . This game was well out of hand early and mismatches like this are ugly to watch for NBA fans . Not many teams can keep up with Golden State and especially not the Lakers . The Warriors blitzed them in the first quarter and then hit them even harder coming out after the half time . Klay Thompson was the star of the show , as he scored 22 first quarter points and finished the game with 36 in total . Steph Curry had to leave this game in the third quarter after re - aggravating his shin injury and Warriors fans have to be concerned at this point with hs continuous distress . After getting three - straight triple - doubles , Draymond Green had a subpar outing , by scoring just nine points while grabbing 12 rebounds in the win . Golden State has a few days off until they play the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday in their next game . The Lakers came into this game with a miraculous three - game winning streak , but left with a blowout loss in an expected scenario . Considering the spread was at 15 points coming in , the final scoreline doesn’t look as bad . Only one Lakers player scored more than 11 points , as everyone struggled to find their shot . Jordan Clarkson was the only bright spot , as he scored a team - high 23 points in just 29 minutes of action . They did have to play this game without Kobe Bryant and D'Angelo Russell , but the result likely would have been the same even if those two played . Los Angeles will look to bounce back in their next game against the surging Sacramento Kings on Thursday .

Despite Friday 's zero point outing where he played only 13 minutes , Gay has now scored 22 points or more in his last four games . Ben McLemore went 6 - for - 11 from the field and 3 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score 17 points , while also adding five rebounds . It was the most points he 's scored since mid - December , so it was good to see him dial in his shot Wednesday . Having one of his least productive games in awhile , DeMarcus Cousins finished with only 13 points ( 5 - 10 FG , 3 - 4 FT ) , four rebounds and two blocked shots . He matched a season - high of nine turnovers as well , so he 'll need to cut those down if the Kings want a chance at winning in the future . The Raptors ' next game will be on the road against the Brooklyn Nets on Friday , while the Kings will travel to Cleveland to play the Cavaliers on Friday .

They came out with a big third quarter though , where they out - scored the Kings 37 - 18 to give them just enough of a lead to secure the seven - point win in front of their home crowd . While both teams are likely going to miss the playoffs , it was still a nice win for the Sixers , who notch just their fifteenth victory of the season . The Sixers did n't have the best night shooting the ball , but they still finished at 47 percent from the field and 28 percent from the three - point line as a team . Robert Covington led the way , scoring 24 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 6 - 12 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) , to go along with two assists and three steals . It was the most points he 's scored since the beginning of February , as he matched a season - high in hitting six three - point shots.Covington did receive some help though , as Nerlens Noel finished with 16 points ( 7 - 13 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) , 12 rebounds and a blocked shot . Noel remains inconsistent with his scoring , but continues to dominate the boards and has grabbed double - digit rebounds in seven of his last eight games . He 's averaging 9 points and 8 rebounds on the season . The Sixers also got some help from the bench from rookie Jerami Grant . Grant went 5 - for - 7 from the field to score 13 points , while also adding two steals and four blocked shots in 29 minutes . He had gone a combined 1 - for - 7 from the field over his last two games , so it was good to see him get things turned around . Ish Smith added 10 points ( 3 - 11 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , five rebounds and nine assists off the bench as well . Despite taking the loss , DeMarcus Cousins had himself a monster game . Cousins went 12 - for - 24 from the field and 15 - for - 20 from the free throw line to score a game - high of 39 points , while also grabbing 24 rebounds in the process . Cousins continues to play well of late , as this was his fifth straight double - double . Over that five - game stretch , he 's averaging 25 points and 16 rebounds , as he 's one of the hottest players in the league . Rudy Gay also did his best in keeping the Kings close . In 40 minutes on the court , Gay finished with 24 points ( 7 - 17 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 9 - 10 FT ) and four rebounds . Like Cousins , he 's played extremely well over his last five games , averaging 28 points during that span , while shooting over 40 percent in each of those matchups as well.The only other King in double figures was Derrick Williams , who came off the bench for 15 points ( 5 - 9 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and three rebounds in 31 minutes . The Sixers ' next game will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday , while the Kings will travel to Washington to play the Wizards on Saturday .
The Utah Jazz ( 13 - 16 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 2 - 31 ) 95 - 91 on Monday . The Philadelphia 76ers may only have two wins on their lowly season , but recently acquired point guard Ish Smith has provided a spark in the backcourt for the NBA’s last place team . A semblance of offense looks to be in motion with Smith at the helm , as the 76ers overcame a 58 - 45 halftime deficit , and were competitive through the last possessions of the game . Smith finished with 22 points and dished out 11 assists on 8 - of - 21 shooting in 32 minutes . The Wake Forest product made a beautiful move to get a solid look to tie the game with the shot clock turned off in the 4th quarter , but the shot did not fall . JaKarr Sampson got the start in favor of the injured Jahlil Okafor ( knee ) and provided six points and five rebounds in 19 minutes . Nerlens Noel was effective under the rim , as the big man blocked five shots , to go along with 18 points and six rebounds . Richaun Holmes also contributed 18 points in the losing effort . Philadelphia could not find a rhythm from 3 - point territory , shooting 24 percent as a unit . The 76ers will visit the Sacramento Kings ( 12 - 18 ) on Wednesday . The Jazz earned a tough win , even after storming out to a 21 point lead in the first half . Gordon Hayward put forth a volume effort , and although his percentage was not in the realm of efficiency , his 3 - pointer in the final :30 gave Utah the lead , and eventually , the win . Hayward led all scorers with 24 points , to go along with six rebounds and four assists on 6 - of - 21 shooting . Jeff Withey drew the start , as Derrick Favors ( back ) sat his second consecutive game . Withey added a double - double in the win , scoring 11 points and bringing in 12 rebounds in 23 minutes . Utah did the majority of their damage from the free throw line , nailing 32 - of - 36 from the charity stripe , which made up for the horrid 33 percent shooting from the field . Trey Burke led the bench with 14 points . The Jazz head to Minnesota to face the struggling Timberwolves ( 11 - 20 ) on Wednesday .
Suns point guard Eric Bledsoe is having by far the most productive season of his career so far , making this cold stretch he has been on over his last four games even more uncharacteristic . His performance Wednesday night was the worst of them all , with Bledsoe shooting just 3 - of - 15 while still managing to come up with 16 points thanks to some good free throw shooting . But this is starting to become a trend , as Bledsoe has shot 13 - of - 47 ( 28 percent ) from the field over his last four contests . Despite those horrific shooting numbers , Bledsoe has still managed to average 16 points per game over that stretch , but that is only because of his ability to get to the line . Bledsoe has shot 31 - of - 35 ( 89 percent ) from the charity stripe in those four games , effectively covering up how much the point guard has really struggled as of late .
The dynamic duo of Gordon Hayward and Rudy Gobert led the Jazz , with the former supplying a game - high 30 points and the latter a 15 - point , 16 - rebound double - double that was his 13th in the last 14 games . Shelvin Mack and Rodney Hood also had matching 15 - point efforts . Joe Johnson led Utah 's second unit with a modest seven points . The Utah defense stymied the Nets ' attack overall , limiting them to 42 percent shooting and eliciting 15 turnovers . Trevor Booker 's 17 - point , 15 - rebound double - double paced Brooklyn , while Brook Lopez managed 14 points , six rebounds , two steals and two blocks in a tough matchup against Gobert . Isaiah Whitehead went for 12 points in another start , and Bojan Bogdanovic and Sean Kilpatrick put forth a pair of eight - point performances . Rondae Hollis-Jefferson turned in 11 points in 14 minutes to lead the bench .

E'Twaun Moore was solid with 6 - of - 11 shooting on his way to 15 points , along with four assists , in 23 minutes . The Pelicans shot 57 percent from long range . Damian Lillard led the way for Portland with 27 points , on 9 - of - 19 shooting , along with 11 assists and four rebounds , in 36 minutes . C.J .

Mason Plumlee came close to a triple - double as he tallied 12 points , 14 rebounds and eight assists , in 33 minutes .
The Clippers ( 19 - 13 ) put an end to the Wizards ' ( 14 - 15 ) hot streak with a 108 - 91 victory at Verizon Center on Monday . The big story for the Clippers has been the absence of forward Blake Griffin , who is out at least two weeks with a quad injury . The thing is , Los Angeles does n't seem to be missing Griffin that much after a third straight win - - second with Griffin sidelined . The Clippers jumped out to a commanding lead in the first quarter behind Chris Paul , who finished with a team - high 23 points and seven assists . Center DeAndre Jordan also stepped up big with Griffin out , pouring in 15 points with 13 rebounds , though Los Angeles lost the battle on the boards 45 to 37 . In the end , Paul was able to get the best of John Wall , who managed to score 23 points , but disappeared late in the game in going scoreless in the fourth quarter . Despite the late - game struggles , Wall still dished out 11 assists and has posted six consecutive double - doubles . Otto Porter Jr. finally looked healthy , scoring 21 points on 8 - of - 12 shooting with three 3 - pointers and eight rebounds over 33 minutes . Porter Jr. had only played 19 minutes in the Wizards ' previous game and had missed three prior to that while dealing with a thigh injury . The unsung hero of the night for the Clippers was Jamal Crawford , who is known to rise to the occasion throughout his career . He came off the bench to score 21 points on 9 - of - 12 shooting and three treys to provide some extra scoring punch behind Paul and Jordan . Other role players also stepped up ; Cole Aldrich had his best game of the season with 13 points , six rebounds , four steals and three assists in 20 minutes , while Wesley Johnson added 14 points .
The Sixers have been one of the three - worst teams in the league with Joel Embiid off the floor and that proved to be the case again here . They dug themselves too big of a hole early on , as the Bulls led by 14 points after the first quarter . Shooting was key , with Chicago hitting 51 percent from the field and 57 percent from three - point range . Ersan Ilyasova stepped up in Embiid 's absence , totaling 31 points and 11 rebounds .

The New York Knicks defeated the Charlotte Hornets , 110 - 107 , at Madison Square Garden on Friday . Despite there being only five ties and six lead changes , this game was close throughout . In fact , neither team led by more than 11 points , as it came down to the finals seconds . New York really turned it on in the fourth quarter , outscoring Charlotte , 28 - 20 . The defensive statistics were decisive , with the Knicks recording eight steals and 10 blocks , while the Hornets tallied just five steals and four blocks .

The Hornets ( 23 - 24 ) have now lost 10 of their last 14 games , as they continue to regress .

Nicolas Batum fell just shy of a triple - double , collecting 15 points , 11 rebounds and nine assists . Marvin Williams totaled 17 points and three rebounds .

Courtney Lee played 35 minutes and contributed 16 points , three rebounds and four assists . New York will play the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday for their next game .
Al Horford 's 14 points per game this season is his lowest scoring average since his second year in the NBA , but the big man affects the game in so many different ways beyond scoring , most of which do n't even show up in the box score . Two of those ways , however , do show up , and they are his rebounds and assists . The Celtics have great rebounding guards and wings that take the pressure off Horford , but when the big man gets on the boards and distributes , Boston has little problem finding success . Horford recorded six rebounds and six assists in Wednesday 's road victory over the Warriors , and when he has recorded those totals this season , the Celtics are 9 - 3 . Even more telling is the fact that in those 12 games , Horford is averaging just 12 points , showing that he is making an big impact , even when the scoring column does n't say so .
The visiting Cleveland Cavaliers demolished the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday , 126 - 94 . For Cleveland ( 15 - 5 ) , the win comes as a major shift of momentum . The Cavs had lost three in a row headed into their matchup in Toronto on Monday , but have won twice this week on the road against stiff competition . On Wednesday , the Cavaliers showed why they are the reigning champions , destroying the Knicks by 32 points to snap New York 's four - game win streak . The `` big three '' of LeBron James , Kevin Love , and Kyrie Irving combined for 74 points and 15 assists , helping to lead the team to the blowout victory .

Smith ( knee ) , the Cavs hit 22 three - pointers while rolling to the easy win . For New York ( 12 - 10 ) , meanwhile , the loss brought the team 's four - game win streak to an abrupt halt . The Knicks saw below - average production almost across the board , as star Carmelo Anthony scored just eight points and rising star Kristaps Porzingis shot just 5 - of - 15 . While Cleveland shot almost 49 percent , the Knicks barely cracked 40 from the field . New York also managed just half as many three - pointers as Cleveland did , hitting only 11 - of - 31 from beyond the arc . On Friday , the Cavs will host the Miami Heat while the Knicks will travel to Sacramento to play the Kings .
The Dallas Mavericks ( 36 - 38 ) defeated the Denver Nuggets ( 31 - 44 ) 97 - 88 on Monday . Most of the statistics would indicate a Denver win , but there was one glaring stat that kept this game close . It was the turnover differential , as the Nuggets committed 21 turnovers , with the Mavericks committing just three . Those three turnovers actually set a franchise record for the Mavericks , as their franchise - low was four before this game . Denver dominated the shooting and rebounding though , as they shot 44 percent to Dallas ' 41 percent and outrebounded them 44 to 34 . Despite playing shorthanded , the Mavericks got a much needed win in this matchup . They had lost six of seven before this , but this win put them in a tie for the eight - seed in the west . J.J. Barea was huge off the bench , as he tallied 18 points and 11 assists in the win . Dwight Powell got a rare start and led the starters with 16 points , while also snatching down seven boards . All five Dallas starters scored in double figures in their victory . On deck for Dallas is a matchup with the New York Knicks on Wednesday .

Will Barton was solid off the bench , as he amassed a game - high 23 points and eight rebounds . Kenneth Faried made a return from a six - game absence to contribute nine points and 11 rebounds . Up next for the Nuggets is a matchup with the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday .
For the Detroit Pistons , the starting five did most of the heavy lifting on Wednesday . Every starter scored at least 13 points , while no one on the bench scored more than 12 . Point guard Reggie Jackson shot 10 - of - 20 and scored a team - high 26 points , while All-Star big man Andre Drummond pulled down a whopping 17 rebounds . Forward Marcus Morris stuffed the stat sheet with 14 points , 10 rebounds , and seven assists on the night . The Pistons finished shooting almost 50 percent and held a massive 60 - 32 rebounding advantage over the Hawks . It was just a 38 percent shooting night for the Hawks in what was a dismal performance . All-Star big man Paul Millsap scored 21 points to go with eight rebounds and four assists . That was about it for Atlanta , though , as no other player scored above 13 and the team consistently struggled . The Hawks finished with only six three - pointers on the night .
The Orlando Magic ( 25 - 53 ) defeated the Chicago Bulls ( 46 - 32 ) 105 - 103 on Wednesday at the Amway Center in Orlando . Down two with just over six seconds left in the game , it was Pau Gasol who was able to force his way to the free throw line and hit a pair of free throws to tie the game up . Victor Oladipo then came up clutch for the Magic , driving for a layup with just a second left in the game , therefore giving them a two point lead and eventually the victory . With the loss , the Bulls move into a tie with the Toronto Raptors for the third projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference . With just four games left in the regular season , it will be a battle for future playoff positioning from here on out .

Along with making the game - winning layup , Oladipo had 23 points ( 8 - 14 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , five assists and three steals over 41 minutes . After shooting less than 35 percent from the field in his two previous games , Oladipo got back on track a bit Wednesday with his shot , finishing at 46 percent . Nikola Vucevic played a big factor in the win as well , posting 22 points ( 9 - 16 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) and seven rebounds . He continues to be one of the more consistent players on this team , as he 's averaging 26 points and 10 rebounds over his last three games . The third starter in double figures was Elfrid Payton , who nearly recorded a triple - double with 17 points ( 6 - 14 FG , 2 - 2 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) , nine rebounds and nine assists . He 's been doing a little bit of everything for this team , averaging 13 points , 6 rebounds , 9 assists and 3 steals in his last four games . Jimmy Butler did his best to keep the Bulls in this game , going 6 - for - 10 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 19 points , while also adding six assists and two steals . He 's now pushed his season averages to 20 points , 6 rebounds and 3 assists per game . Pau Gasol did n't have the best day shooting the ball , but got to the free throw line a bunch to record 15 points ( 4 - 10 FG , 7 - 9 FT ) , nine rebounds and three blocked shots . Over his last three games , he 's now averaging 18 point and 9 rebounds , but he 'll need to do even better if the Bulls want to make a run in the playoffs . The Bulls also had some solid contributions from their bench . Taj Gibson recorded an efficient 15 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 3 - 5 FT ) and seven rebounds , while Nikola Mirotic added 15 points ( 3 - 11 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) of his own over 27 minutes . The Bulls ' next game will be on the road against the Miami Heat on Thursday , while the Magic will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Friday .
The Detroit Pistons defeated the Dallas Mavericks , 98 - 91 , at Palace of Auburn Hills on Wednesday . This game looked like a laugher early on , but Dallas made a late run in the second half for a respectable scoreline . Detroit actually took a game - high 27 - point lead headed into the half , but Dallas got it all the way down to a seven - point deficit , which happened to be the final margin . It was a wire - to - wire win for the Pistons , as they led by at least seven points for the final 44 minutes . Defense was key , as they held Dallas to 39 percent from the field and 28 percent from three - point range . Rebounding was the biggest factor for Detroit though , winning that battle , 57 - 38 . The Mavericks ( 22 - 34 ) simply dug themselves too big of a hole in this game and it 's not how they wanted to head into the All-star break . Dirk Nowitzki had a renaissance game though , as he led the team with 24 points and 10 rebounds . Harrison Barnes finished second on the team with 16 points and five rebounds . Seth Curry totaled 13 points , two rebounds , three assists and two steals , while Deron Williams collected 12 points , and six assists .

In five of the six games that the Lakers have lost during their rough streak , Williams has scored at least 24 points , adding another 24 - point game against the Knicks . It actually falls on the lower end of the scoring spectrum for Williams in his increased minutes , as three of those games he scored at least 30 points . As for the Knicks , Kristaps Porzingis played both ends of the floor effectively , racking up 26 points , to go along with 12 rebounds , two assists and seven blocks on 8 - of - 15 shooting .

The premier point guard was responsible for the driving layup to bring the game within one point with 0:34 left in the fourth quarter , and buried the 27 - foot three pointer to tie the game at 103 - 103 points each to force overtime . Once again , Westbrook tallied a triple - double , en route to a remarkable season on paper , and an impressive record given the loss they suffered in the offseason . The Pacers were resilient in the victory , not losing focus even after the uber athletic Westbrook dominated his matchup throughout the game . Indiana was without their superstar Paul George ( ankle ) , who will miss Monday 's game against the Warriors as well . Glenn Robinson III was the difference maker in overtime after bringing in an important defensive rebound and turning it into a strong dunk on the other end to take a five point lead with 1:28 remaining in the extra period .

These are two teams going in opposite directions , but Dallas showed some resiliency here with a road win . Harrison Barnes continues to develop as a go - to guy , as he has 65 points across his last two games . J.J. Barea has been equally as good , as he has at least 18 points and five assists across his last three games . Seth Curry 's 23 points were a season - high , as he got plenty of run with Deron Williams out of the lineup . Luol Deng continues to struggle , as he 's failed to surpass seven points or seven rebound over his last three games . Lou Williams continued his run at a coveted sixth - man award , as his 15 points marked his fifth - straight game with at least 14 points scored . Jordan Clarkson scored his 22 points on just 12 shots , as he went 9 - of - 12 from the field . These two teams will have a rematch on December 29 back in Los Angeles .
The Warriors ( 49 - 12 ) held off a late run to defeat the Clippers ( 40 - 23 ) at ORACLE Arena in Oakland on Sunday afternoon . Golden State , which led by seven at halftime , broke the game open in the third quarter , outscoring Los Angeles 30 - 18 in the period . Stephen Curry spurred a 9 - 2 run in the middle of the quarter punctuated by a jaw - dropping play in which he weaved through four Clippers defenders before splashing in a long , pull - up three - pointer with nine seconds left on the shot clock . The basket put the Warriors up 13 points , and the lead swelled to 16 on the next possession when Draymond Green put in a running layup plus the foul . The Clippers trailed by 19 entering the fourth quarter but went on a 16 - 5 run late in the period , slicing the deficit to just eight with a minute to play . They’d be held scoreless the rest of the way , however , losing for the second time in a row after falling to the Trail Blazers in overtime Wednesday night . Aside from the mini - run in the third quarter , Curry was kept in check , finishing with only 12 points in 32 minutes . Green paced Golden State with 23 points and six rebounds , while Klay Thompson chipped in 21 points , including three three - pointers . Shaun Livingston added 21 points and eight rebounds off the bench in 28 minutes . The Clippers were led by 22 points from Austin Rivers , who made 8 - of - 14 field goal attempts .

The New Orleans Pelicans ( 30 - 27 ) defeated the Brooklyn Nets ( 23 - 32 ) 102 - 96 on Wednesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans . Despite finishing with just a six - point victory , the Pelicans were much better with their shooting percentages . They went 51 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three - point line , while the Nets went 42 percent from the floor and 33 percent from deep . What really kept the Nets in this game was their ability to force the Pelicans into turnovers , as the Pelicans had 20 turnovers compared to just 12 from the Nets . This was a big win for the Pelicans , as they continue to trail the Thunder for the final projected playoff spot in the Western Conference standings . Seemingly coming out of nowhere , Quincy Pondexter was a huge reason the Pelicans were able to grab a win , despite missing both Anthony Davis and Ryan Anderson . He went 9 - for - 13 from the field and 4 - for - 8 from the three - point line to finish with a game - high of 25 points , to go along with five rebounds . It was a new season - high for Pondexter in just his fourth start of the year , as it was his first time breaking the 20 - point mark . Tyreke Evans also had a strong showing , posting 15 points ( 5 - 13 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , 11 assists and two blocked shots . It was his third double - double over his last four games , a stretch where he 's averaged 14 points and 10 assists . As long as Davis is out , Evans should continue to be the go - to player on offense . Notching a double - double of his own , Omer Asik recorded 12 points ( 5 - 6 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) and 13 rebounds . He 's combined for 26 points and 24 rebounds over his last two games . Both Norris Cole and Alexis Ajinca reached double figures in points off the bench , with 11 and 10 points respectively . The Nets saw their most production from Joe Johnson , who went 9 - for - 17 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 21 points , while adding 10 rebounds as well . He 's played well of late , averaging 19 points and eight rebounds over his last three games . A big reason for the Nets keeping this game close was their bench though , who combined to score 49 of the teams 96 points . Thaddeus Young was one of those players , as he went off for 19 points ( 8 - 12 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 2 - 4 FT ) and five rebounds . Over his last two outings with the Nets , he 's combined for 34 points and 10 rebounds , as he looks to be getting more and more comfortable with his new team . Brook Lopez and Jarrett Jack were the other two bench contributors . Lopez had 15 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 1 - 1 FT ) , seven rebounds and four blocked shots , while Jack posted 15 points ( 5 - 12 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) and three assists . The Pelicans ' next game will be at home against the Miami Heat on Friday , while the Nets will travel to Houston to play the Rockets on Friday .
The Boston Celtics ( 31 - 22 ) earned a home win Sunday over the Sacramento Kings ( 21 - 30 ) at TD Garden , 128 - 119 . Sacramento scored the game 's first four points , but the Celtics immediately rattled off a 90 run to take a lead they never relinquished . Boston scored 46 points in a frantic first quarter and was brilliant offensively all day , as they shot a sharp 56 percent from the field and 55 percent from three . Boston 's starting backcourt powered the Celtics offense , as Avery Bradley led the team with 25 points ( 9 - 16 FG , 6 - 7 3PT ) and Isaiah Thomas ( 8 - 18 FG ) added 22 . Jared Sullinger ( 10 - 13 FG , 21 points ) and Tyler Zeller ( 6 - 8 FG , 17 points ) gave Boston an efficient inside attack as well . DeMarcus Cousins led the Kings with a game - high 31 points and added seven rebounds and six assists . Rajon Rondo scored 14 points and dished 15 assists and Willie Cauley-Stein scored 15 behind sharp 7 - 9 shooting from the field . But the Kings had no defensive answer for Boston and their brilliant shooting night . Boston will take to the road for a matchup Tuesday in Milwaukee . Sacramento 's road trip continues Monday against Cleveland .
The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 26 - 9 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 4 - 36 ) 95 - 85 on Sunday . The Cavs likely got more than they bargained for from a game Sixers squad that played them tough through all four quarters . Philadelphia 's collective defensive effort may have been the most surprising aspect of the game overall , as they managed to hold a hot Cleveland offense to a mediocre 39 percent shooting performance from the field , and 28 percent from beyond the arc . To provide some more tangible perspective on the noteworthiness of the Sixers ' effort , one has to realize the Cavs had tallied 53 and 48 percent figures , respectively , in those same categories against the Timberwolves in their most recent contest , and had also scored over 120 points in their two previous games . Cleveland was able to pull out the hard - fought victory on the back of LeBron James , who turned in a 37 - point , seven - rebound , nine - assist effort that also included a pair of steals . The other starters ' scoring contributions paled in comparison , as Kevin Love was the next closest with 15 points . However , Love was outstanding on the glass against a vulnerable Philadelphia frontcourt , hauling in 15 rebounds and adding seven assists and two steals . J.R. Smith added 14 points , three rebounds and a steal , and drained another four three - pointers in the process . Tristan Thompson had his own double - double in another start at center , collecting 10 points and grabbing 10 boards . Kyrie Irving had a second consecutive quiet game , notching eight points , five rebounds , two assists , two steals and a block over 31 minutes . Although his contributions in non - scoring categories were certainly solid , Irving notably struggled from the field , draining only three of 15 shot attempts . The Cavs improved to 26 - 9 and remain atop the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They now head to Dallas to take on the Mavericks on Tuesday . Philadelphia 's valiant effort was spearheaded by Jahlil Okafor 's 21 points , which he supplemented with seven rebounds . Ish Smith put together a second straight strong performance after a string of relatively quiet games , tallying a double - double with 18 points and 10 assists . He also added seven boards and a steal . Jerami Grant and Nik Stauskas could only put together a pair of six - point outings , while Hollis Thompson paced the Philadephia bench with eight points and three rebounds . The Sixers fell to 4 - 36 and remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They await the Chicago Bulls for a Thursday matchup .
The Los Angeles Clippers ( 18 - 13 ) defeated the Utah Jazz ( 12 - 16 ) 109 - 104 on Saturday . The Clippers came into Saturday’s matchup as part of the second game of a back - to - back , and utilized the 3 - point shot to make up for defensive breakdowns early in the game . Los Angeles was without Blake Griffin ( quad ) , who is amongst the league 's best with 23 points per game and 9 rebounds per game , but that did not stop Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan from running the pick and roll at an efficient rate . Add that to J.J. Reddick and Paul Pierce’s sharp shooting from deep and the equation resulted in a second straight win . Reddick led all Clippers’ with 25 points on 5 - of - 7 3 - point shooting , including a streak of three straight deep balls on consecutive possessions in the second half . Paul Pierce was equally impressive , finishing with 20 points on 5 - of - 7 behind the arc . Pure point guard Chris Paul added 19 points and 11 assists , while DeAndre Jordan completed another double - double , with 14 points and 13 rebounds . The first half defensive inefficiencies need to be addressed by the Clippers , but the team shot 50 percent from deep as a unit , which made up for the slow , turnover ridden start . Los Angeles will continue their road trip and face the Washington Wizards ( 14 - 14 ) on Monday . Utah stormed out to a strong 1st quarter , but were unable to capitalize on the momentum going forward . Gordon Hayward led all scorers with 28 points , to go along with six rebounds and five assists on 7 - of - 13 shooting . The backcourt duo of Alec Burks and Trey Burke , who currently combine for the best scoring bench duo in the league , thrived in the first half before going cold later in the latter quarters . Burks finished with 11 points on a perfect 5 - of - 5 shooting in 18 minutes , while Michigan product Burke , added five points in the same amount of time . Rudy Gobert ( knee ) continues to miss games with a knee injury , and the absence of their shot blocking big man has caused the Jazz to run a small lineup . The lack of size and rim protection allowed DeAndre Jordan to take advantage for the inopportune , easy basket . Utah’s biggest strength in the first period was their pace , but as that died out in the second half , so did the team as a whole . Utah will look to bounce back when they host the Philadelphia 76ers ( 2 - 30 ) on Monday .
The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Washington Wizards , 109 - 102 , at Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday . The Sixers ( 2 - 9 ) made a couple of changes up front to their starting lineup , and both proved key to their second straight home win . Jahlil Okafor took his starting turn in the ongoing center rotation with Joel Embiid and led the team with 19 points , while Ersan Ilyasova , who entered the first unit in place of Dario Saric , was right behind him with a 16 - point tally . Philadelphia also received 49 points from their bench , which was spearheaded by a trio of double - digit scoring efforts . In all , the home team posted a stellar 55 percent success rate from the field . while also holding the Wizards ( 2 - 8 ) to a 42 percent tally . Washington was unsurprisingly led by John Wall , who managed 27 points , six assists , four rebounds and a steal . Markieff Morris followed with 19 points , four rebounds and a steal . Otto Porter managed a 15 - point , 13 - rebound double - double , which also included an assist , four steals and a block . He struggled considerably from the field , however , going just 5 - of - 17 . Marcin Gorat tallied a 10 - point , 14 - rebound double - double , while Marcus Thornton paced the reserves with a 10 - point effort . Okafor complemented his team - high scoring haul with five rebounds and two assists . Ilyasova added four boards to his 16 points . Gerald Henderson supplied 14 points , three assists , a rebound and a block . The bench was led by Nik Stauskas , who posted 15 points , two assists and a rebound . Saric responded to his demotion to the second unit with an impressive 13 - point , 12 - rebound double - double . Hollis Thompson also contributed 11 points in a reserve role , along with two rebounds , an assist and a steal . The Wizards head back home to face the New York Knicks on Thursday , while the Sixers head to Minnesota for their Thursday date with the Minnesota Timberwolves .
The New Orleans Pelicans ( 32 - 27 ) defeated the Denver Nuggets ( 20 - 39 ) 99 - 92 on Sunday at the Pepsi Center in Denver . Coming out of the third quarter , the game was tied at 65 - 65 and anyones to lose . The Pelicans got hot in the fourth though , and out - scored the Nuggets 34 - 27 to finish off the game and steal a road win in Denver . The Pelicans shot 49 percent from the field , while the Nuggets finished at just 49 percent . The Pelicans also made a huge difference at the free throw line , making 22 - of - 30 , while the Nuggets made just 9 - of - 17 . The Pelicans were again without both Anthony Davis and Ryan Anderson Sunday . Their backcourt picked up the slack this time around . Tyreke Evans led the charge , going 7 - for - 14 from the field to score a team - high of 22 points , while adding seven rebounds and seven assists . He had recorded three straight double - doubles coming into this matchup , but he was n't able to keep the streak alive . Over his last four games , he 's averaging 17 points and 10 assists . Eric Gordon had a strong showing as well , finishing with 18 points ( 6 - 14 FG , 3 - 10 3Pt , 3 - 5 FT ) and two assists in 32 minutes . He 's now combined for 38 points and 10 assists over his last two games . Starting in place of Davis , Dante Cunningham posted 14 points ( 7 - 12 FG ) and seven rebounds . Despite averaging only 6 points on the season , he 's played well in extended time lately , reaching double figures in points in three straight games . Both Alexis Ajinca and Norris Cole added 10 points off the bench . The Nuggets saw their biggest production from Danilo Gallinari , who finished with 21 points ( 7 - 18 FG , 2 - 8 3Pt , 5 - 6 FT ) and four rebounds . With so many injuries and shake - ups to the starting lineup , he 's been one of the few consistent players , posting 20 or more points in three of his last four games . Over those four games , he 's averaging 19 points and 4 rebounds . Getting the start at shooting guard with the Nuggets using a small lineup due to Jusuf Nurkic 's injury , Randy Foye was very successful in extended minutes . He went 7 - for - 13 from the field and 5 - for - 10 from the three - point line to score 19 points , to go along with two steals in 29 minutes . It marked just the fourth time this season he reached double figures in points , so it was a nice surprise for the Nuggets . Coming off the bench , Will Barton continued with his impressive stretch . In 20 minutes , he double - doubled with 16 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) , 10 rebounds and two steals . Since joining the Nuggets at the trade deadline , he 's averaging 17 points and 5 rebounds over five games . The Pelicans ' next game will be on the road against the Dallas Mavericks on Monday , while the Nuggets will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday .
The Phoenix Suns ( 15 - 24 ) defeated the Charlotte Hornets ( 17 - 18 ) 111 - 102 on Wednesday night . In a battle of two struggling teams , the home team prevailed in a much needed way . Phoenix came into this game in the midst of a nine - game losing streak and ended up pulling away with some good offense as a small underdog . They shot 49 percent from the field and went 19 - for - 33 from three - point range in a shooting exhibition . The benches were a huge disparity here , as the Suns bench has three players score 17 or more points , while the Hornets had only one bench player score more than five . The Hornets have now lost five - straight and they are now below .500 for the first time since the middle of November . It 's clear the injury to Nicolas Batum is really hurting this team , as they ca n't get anything going on either end of the floor . Kemba Walker has been playing at an all - time level recently though , but he ca n't do it all himself . He tallied 25 points , six assists and four rebounds in yet another great game . All five starters scored in double - figures actually , but they simply allowed the Suns to run up and down the floor on them far too often . Charlotte will look to end this slide on Saturday against the surging Los Angeles Clippers . The Suns needed a win as bad as any team in the NBA and they finally got one here . The amazing part is that they did it with defense , by holding the Hornets to 17 points in the final quarter . Brandon Knight was the star of the show , as he totaled 18 points , seven assists and three rebounds in the victory . The bench was fantastic as well , as T.J. Warren , Devin Booker , and Mirza Teletovic all scored between 17 and 19 points while combining for 21 rebounds , seven assists and four steals . Without Eric Bledsoe for the rest of the season , they need more team performances like this going forward in order to dig out of this deep hole they 've dug themselves . Phoenix 's next game will be on Friday when they host the Miami Heat in a difficult matchup .
The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the visiting Golden State Warriors , 115 - 101 , in the NBA Finals on Thursday to force Game 7 . In a game where Cleveland had to win to extend their season , they didn’t disappoint . The Cavaliers came out in a fury , as they outscored the Warriors 31 - 11 in the first quarter . In fact , they held Golden State scoreless for the first five minutes , as the Warriors missed their first seven shots . The difference in the game was the shooting , as Golden State were held to 40 percent shooting from the field , while the Cavaliers shot 52 percent on their end . The rebounding was a benefactor for the Cavs as well , with Cleveland recording 45 rebounds to Golden State 's 35 . The Cavaliers recorded 12 steals and seven blocks as well in one of their best team defensive performances of the season . Golden State knew they had two games to secure their second - straight title and they simply didn’t play with enough fire in this game . Steph Curry and Klay Thompson once again carried the load , as they combined for 55 points , with both players shooting under 45 percent from the field . Curry fouled out with five minutes left and was ejected for the first time in his career after throwing his mouthpiece into the stands . Draymond Green was the only other productive starter , as he finished with eight points , 10 rebounds and six assists in the loss . Harrison Barnes went 0 - for - 8 from the field and recorded just two rebounds and no assists on the night . Leandro Barbosa scored 14 points off the bench , with the other seven bench player combining for just 19 points . Cleveland looked down and out after their Game 4 defeat at home , but have made some serious amends with their last two victories . LeBron James was the star yet again , tallying 41 points , 11 assists , eight rebounds , three blocks and four steals in the win . James actually scored 18 - straight points for the Cavaliers between the third and fourth quarters , which approached an NBA Finals record . Kyrie Irving finished with 23 of his own , while also providing two blocks and two steals . Tristan Thompson recorded a double - double , as he accumulated 15 points and 16 rebounds in the victory . J.R. Smith scored 14 of his own , but no other player on the roster scored more than seven points . Cleveland is looking to become the first team in NBA history to overcome a 3 - 1 deficit in the Finals and they 're one win away from that goal . The deciding game is Sunday in Oakland .
The Detroit Pistons defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers , 106 - 90 , at Palace of Auburn Hills on Monday . The form of these teams would indicate an easy Cleveland win , but once LeBron James was declared inactive , Detroit felt as it was their game to have . They took care of business too , as they pulled out a wire - to - wire win and won each individual quarter by at least three points . Defense was key for the Pistons , as they held the Cavaliers to 38 percent shooting , while forcing 21 turnovers to just 30 made baskets . Three-point shooting really carried Detroit as well , as they went 16 - of - 28 from long range in their win . The Cavaliers ( 23 - 7 ) are coming off a historic win against the Golden State Warriors on Sunday , but it led to LeBron James being rested here and a lackluster performance from the rest of the team . Kyrie Irving led Cleveland in scoring , as he accrued 18 points , five rebounds and eight assists . Kevin Love recorded a double - double , tallying 17 points and 14 rebounds , while committing five turnovers in the defeat . Iman Shumpert , Key Felder and Channing Frye all provided 11 points a piece off the bench . Cleveland will be back to full force on Thursday in their next game against the Boston Celtics . The Pistons ( 15 - 18 ) have been in a terrible slide recently and a win over the team like the Cavaliers may be what they need to get going . Tobias Harries was moved to the bench last week and he continues to thrive in that role , as he led the team with 21 points , six rebounds and four assists . Reggie Jackson had one of his best games of the season , as he accumulated 13 points , six rebounds and six assists . Andre Drummond controlled the paint for Detroit , as he totaled 11 points , 17 rebounds and four assists . Kentavious Caldwell-Pope went 7 - of - 11 from the field to collect 18 points , three rebounds , three assists and three steals . Detroit 's next game is on Wednesday against the Milwaukee Bucks .
The benches were thin Wednesday , but ended up playing a huge factor in the Miami Heat 's 108 - 96 win against the Orlando Magic . Four bench players for the Heat combined for 40 points , 17 rebounds and 10 assists , while the Magic 's three bench players accumulated just 17 points , seven rebounds and four assists . Despite going 0 - for - 4 from the free - throw line , Hassan Whiteside had a strong game , posting 18 points , 14 rebounds and four blocks . The 27 assists on 47 made baskets for Miami shows its new up - tempo offense , as eight of the nine players who played recorded a dime in the win . Serge Ibaka struggled in his debut with the Magic , tallying 14 points and seven rebounds on 6 - for - 17 shooting . In addition , his - 18 plus - minus was the worst in the game . All five starters for Orlando played at least 35 minutes , and this could end up being one of the shortest rotations in the NBA .
The Thunder trailed by an 82 - 72 margin entering the fourth quarter but Russell Westbrook 's 31 - foot three - point jumper with seven seconds remaining in regulation knotted the score at 102 . OKC then dominated the Magic by a 12 - 4 margin in the extra period and also won the battle on the glass , 57 - 53 . Westbrook 's mammoth 57 - point , 13 - rebound , 11 - assist triple - double led the Thunder . Enes Kanter posted a 17 - point , 10 - rebound double - double off the bench . Victor Oladipo followed with 13 points . Steven Adams provided seven points and nine boards . Six players posted double - digit scoring for the Magic , with Evan Fournier 's 24 points leading the way . Terrence Ross poured in 23 points and Aaron Gordon totaled 13 . Nikola Vucevic supplied an 11 - point , 16 - rebound double - double . Elfrid Payton tallied 11 points , while Bismack Biyombo 's 12 - point , 11 - rebound double - double led the bench . Andre Roberson posted six points .
Memphis was expected to win this game rather easily , but Sacramento had some other ideas . What makes this win even more unlikely is the fact that the Kings played without Rudy Gay ( hip ) and had DeMarcus Cousins struggle mightily , eventually fouling out in the fourth quarter . The key for them was transition baskets , as they won the fastbreak differential , 20 - 9 . Cousins still finished the game with 22 points and nine rebounds , but went just 7 - of - 20 from the field before fouling out . Kosta Koufos was the hero for the Kings , as he totaled 16 points and 13 rebounds in his best game in years . Garrett Temple got the start for Gay and tallied 17 points , six rebounds and four assists . Mike Conley made his return from a back injury to accumulate eight points , three rebounds and six assists in a rusty performance . Marc Gasol led the Grizzlies in scoring , accruing 20 points , six rebounds and four assists . Tony Allen was the only other starter in double figures , as he accrued 16 points and nine boards .
The Raptors limited the Wizards to 37 percent shooting overall , including 33 percent from three - point range . Meanwhile , Toronto tallied a 51 percent success rate from the floor , overcoming their 17 turnovers . DeMar DeRozan 's 32 - point , 13 - rebound double - double paced Toronto . Norman Powell was next with a bench - leading 21 points . Cory Joseph provided 15 points , while Serge Ibaka supplied 14 . John Wall paced the Wizards with 30 points , eight rebounds , seven assists , three blocks and one steal . Backcourt mate Bradley Beal followed closely behind with 27 points , while Otto Porter , Jr. bounced back from a scoreless outing over 19 minutes Wednesday to generate a full stat line of 18 points , eight rebounds , three assists , three steals and one block . Markieff Morris managed 11 points , while Marcin Gortat produced six points , six rebounds and one assist in an uncharacteristically modest performance .
The Chicago Bulls ( 34 - 20 ) handled the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 33 - 22 ) , 113 - 98 , on Thursday . Chicago enters the All-Star break with a four - game winning streak in hand , during which they held each opponent below 100 points . On the backs of five players achieving double - digit points , the Bulls outscored the Cavaliers in each quarter , yet remain behind in the season series , 1 - 2 . Derrick Rose led the way with 30 points , marking just the fourth time this season he 's surpassed that threshold . In the frontcourt , both Pau Gasol ( 18 points and 10 rebounds ) and Joakim Noah ( 10 points and 15 boards ) tallied double - doubles , with the Spaniard notching his 14th in row . Meanwhile , Tony Snell garnered his third starting nod in six contests due to the absences of Jimmy Butler ( shoulder ) and Kirk Hinrich ( toe ) , and the second - year pro responded with 22 points and a game - high four three - pointers in 38 minutes . Once Chicago returns from their midseason respite , the Detroit Pistons await on Friday , Feb. 20 in the Palace of Auburn Hills . Thursday 's defeat doubles as Cleveland 's second in four outings , but LeBron James did everything in his power to keep the deficit somewhat close , accruing 31 points , five rebounds , and four assists . However , with Kevin Love out of commission as a result of a corneal abrasion sustained during Wednesday 's win against the Miami Heat , the road was all the more winding when 16 turnovers were transformed into 24 points for the Bulls . The Cavaliers ' foibles on offense were compounded by miserable success from three - point range - - just 8 - for - 31 , or 26 percent - - and subsequently , just three of James ' teammates scored in double figures , including Kyrie Irving ( 17 ) , Timofey Mozgov ( 13 ) , and Tristan Thompson ( 10 ) . After the break , Cleveland will embark upon a three - game road trip , tipping off first against the Washington Wizards on Friday , Feb. 20 .
The Utah Jazz ( 29 - 36 ) won their fifth straight game while extending the Detroit Pistons’ ( 23 - 43 ) losing streak to 10 consecutive games , effectively diminishing their playoff hopes in the 88 - 85 win . Andre Drummond was disqualified from the second half with a concussion , per league protocols . The two teams combined for 25 points in the third quarter . Derrick Favors took advantage of Andre Drummond’s absence , scoring 26 points in 35 minutes and attempting a career - high 13 free throws . Rudy Gobert grabbed 19 rebounds and blocked two shots in 39 minutes , padding his stats in a last ditch effort to garner Defensive Player of the Year votes . The Jazz has now won 12 of their past 15 games , overlapping with the trade of Enes Kanter to Oklahoma City . They’re seven games back of the final playoff spot with 17 games remaining , drawing an outside shot of postseason basketball if everything falls their way . Shawne Williams was suspended after squaring off in a head - butting competition with the Trail Blazers’ Joel Freeland in Friday’s loss . Tayshaun Prince was forced from the game with a sore hip , but he returned briefly in the waning moments to inbound the ball . Reggie Jackson was benched down the stretch , turning the ball over five times and making 4 - of - 11 shots . The Pistons’ bench accounted for 52 points in the loss . The Jazz host the Charlotte Hornets on Monday , and the Pistons get two days off before playing the Memphis Grizzlies at home .
Point guard George Hill returned from a toe injury in Thursday 's game between the Jazz and 76ers , and played as though he had n't missed any time at all . Hill led Utah with 21 points , shooting a ridiculous 8 - of - 10 from the field with two three - pointers . Hill added eight rebounds and six assists and came away with three steals on the defensive end . Defensive anchor Rudy Gobert , meanwhile , had two blocks and two steals while leading the team with 13 rebounds . Wings Gordon Hayward and Rodney Hood scored 20 points each , and the Jazz finished the night with 15 three - pointers and over 47 percent shooting from the field . For the Sixers , meanwhile , the game was much less eventful . Forward Ersan Ilyasova led the team with 16 points and 12 rebounds . Rookie Joel Embiid , however , sat the game out for rest , and no other Sixer scored more than 14 .
The host Memphis Grizzlies shut down the powerhouse San Antonio Spurs , 89 - 74 , at FedExForum Arena on Monday . Defense was the key for the Grizzlies ( 32 - 22 ) , who held the Spurs to just 36 percent shooting and a season - low scoring output . The absence of Spurs superstar Kawhi Leonard ( quad ) certainly helped the Grizzlies ' case , but it was a stunning defensive performance nonetheless . The `` Grit and Grind '' Grizz blocked a whopping 11 shots on the night , including three off the bench from big man Brandan Wright .

The Houston Rockets ( 26 - 25 ) defeated the Miami Heat ( 27 - 22 ) 115 - 102 on Tuesday . Both clubs entered the game without their starting centers , but it was a tad more of an unexpected development for the home team . The Rockets found out earlier in the day that Dwight Howard had been suspended for Tuesday night 's game for making contact with an official while protesting a technical foul on Saturday versus the Wizards . With Clint Capela also sidelined with a left hip strain , veteran Josh Smith , reacquired earlier in the month from the Clippers , got the starting call versus Miami . His counterpart on the other side was a well - traveled veteran as well , as Amar'e Stoudemire took the court in Hassan Whiteside 's stead yet again due to the latter 's oblique injury . Both Smith and Stoudemire demonstrated why they 're still viable pieces of their respective squads , with the former coming second only to James Harden in scoring for Houston on the night , and the latter posting a double - double to help keep Miami close the majority of the contest . Ultimately , it was Harden 's remarkable effort , as well as the Rockets ' 52 and 46 percent tallies from the field and three - point range , respectively , that spearheaded the high - scoring victory . Miami was led by Luol Deng , who has come on offensively over the stretch that Whiteside has missed . He managed 17 points , eight rebounds , three assists and a steal .

The starting five 's tally was rounded out by Chris Bosh , who supplied 13 points , seven rebounds , an assist and a block .

They remain in the state of Texas for a Wednesday night showdown with the Dallas Mavericks .

Smith checked in with 19 points , four rebounds , an assist , two steals and a block in his spot start . Beverley contributed on the offensive end as well , amassing 14 points , three rebounds , two assists and a block .

Rebounding was a huge difference as well , with Golden State winning that battle , 47 - 32 . The Warriors also handed out 35 assists on their 57 made baskets . The Clippers ( 30 - 18 ) had to play this game without Chris Paul , but not even his elite defense could have done anything about this onslaught .

They 'll host the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday , and if the team is eager to get their players more rest , it 's possible they 'll use the same lineup Friday . New York is on a 10 - game losing streak , and the media 's honeymoon with the new front office led by Phil Jackson and the team 's rookie head coach Derek Fisher seemed to come to an end this week as several outlets began questioning his rotation choices and the team 's dogged push to install the triangle offense . As a team , they performed well on offense , shooting 49 percent from the field , but they committed 25 personal fouls , giving the Spurs 25 free points at the foul line , which ultimately was their downfall .

It was also a franchise low for any quarter in the playoffs . Boston missed 20 of 23 shots in the first quarter , including six 3 - point attempts , and had six shots blocked . Despite an abysmal 1 - for - 12 shooting night from star forward Paul Millsap , the Hawks easily outscored the Celtics . This was due in large part to five big 3 - pointers from sharpshooting veteran Kyle Korver , who finished with 17 points . Also recording 17 was All-Star big man Al Horford , who blocked five shots . Things have gotten off to a rocky start for the Celtics in the series . Guard Avery Bradley will likely miss the remainder of the series with a right hamstring injury , while guard Marcus Smart and big man Kelly Olynyk have more minor injuries .

After a hard - fought third overtime , the Nets were able to pull away in the end . The Bucks shared the ball on Friday . Ersan Ilyasova had 20 points ( 8 - 19 , 4 - 6 3Pt ) , Antetokounmpo had 23 ( 7 - 19 FG ) , Zaza Pachulia had 22 ( 9 - 16 FG ) and Michael Carter-Williams had 19 ( 7 - 26 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt ) . Brook Lopez led the Nets in scoring with 32 points ( 13 - 20 FG ) , to go with 18 rebounds , two assists and five blocks . Thaddeus Young contributed 24 points ( 8 - 20 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt ) , five rebounds , three assists and one steal . March has been a bad month for the Bucks . They 've lost eight of their last ten . The Bucks have struggled offensively since dealing Brandon Knight to the Suns . They 're shooting 43 percent from the field in his absence , down from 46 percent on the season . Recent injuries have exacerbated the situation . Jared Dudley ( back ) and O.J . Mayo ( hamstring ) were out against the Nets . Both have lingering injuries , and there 's no definite timetable for their return . The Nets are also struggling . They 've lost six of their last ten games . On Wednesday , they were blown out by the Cavaliers 117 - 92 . The Bucks are currently sixth in the Eastern Conference , six games behind fifth - place Washington . The Nets are battling for a playoff spot , 2 games out of eighth place in the East , so Friday 's game was a much - needed victory . The Bucks lead the season series 2 - 1 .
The Milwaukee Bucks ( 1 - 3 ) defeated the Chicago Bulls ( 3 - 1 ) , 92 - 90 , on a buzzer beating shot Saturday in Game 4 of their Opening Round Series . In a potential close - out game for Chicago , it was Milwaukee who did the closing Saturday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center . The Bucks were able to put Thursday 's gutting double overtime defeat behind them with a thrilling win at the buzzer to extend the series for at least one more game . When O.J Mayo canned a three pointer to put the Bucks up six with 1:44 remaining , it looked as though the Bucks were on their way to a victory in front of the home crowd . The Bulls charged back , though , mounting a six point run to tie the game . A Bulls turnover with just over a second left allowed the Bucks to call a timeout and get set for one last play . The Bulls keyed on Khris Middleton on the inbounds play , allowing Jerryd Bayless to cut to the basket where he hit the game winning layup as time expired . The series will shift back to Chicago on Monday for Game 5 . Chicago trailed by as many as 18 in Game 3 but was able to mount a comeback and notch a victory in double overtime ; Saturday 's script went differently , however . Turnovers marred Chicago 's ability to finish off the Bucks on Saturday . The Bulls committed 28 turnovers , which the Bucks turned into 39 points . Derrick Rose was responsible for eight of those turnovers and just six assists . Nikola Mirotic was able to play after missing Thursday 's game with a quadriceps injury but finished with just five points on 2 - of - 7 shooting over 20 minutes on the floor . One bright spot for Chicago was the play of Jimmy Butler , who looked unstoppable on his way to scoring 33 points . Chicago will look to close out the series Monday on its home court . Milwaukee made use of its depth to get the thrilling win Saturday . Jerryd Bayless was the hero with the game winning shot , but there were other key contributors off Milwaukee 's bench . O.J Mayo led the Bucks in scoring with 18 points in 24 minutes and John Henson had a huge impact on the defensive end with four blocks and a steal . Henson also pulled down three offensive rebounds and five boards overall . Three of Milwaukee 's bench players scored as many or more points than all of its starters individually . The Bucks will look to use the momentum from Saturday 's victory to stay alive in the series Monday .
With double - digit scoring performances from all five starters , the Milwaukee Bucks ( 28 - 38 ) took down the New Orleans Pelicans ( 24 - 41 ) on Saturday , 103 - 92 . Guard Khris Middleton neared a triple - double on Saturday , dropping 19 points , 10 rebounds , and eight assists while also snagging three steals on the defensive end . Middleton went cold from deep , missing all four of his three - point attempts , but still managed to go an efficient 9 - for - 16 from the field . Red-hot sophomore Jabari Parker also grabbed three steals , while also scoring 15 points and pulling down five rebounds . The team as a whole shot an impressive 49 percent from the field while playing outstanding defense , holding the Pelicans to 39 percent shooting on the night . New Orleans could n't seal the deal despite 29 points and 11 rebounds from star Anthony Davis . While Davis had 29 , the rest of the starting five scored just 30 total points , and the bench also saw struggles . Sixth man Jrue Holiday scored just eight points in 29 minutes while turning the ball over seven times . The team struggled mightily from deep , hitting just 21 percent of their three - pointers . New Orleans will face the Golden State Warriors on Monday , while the Bucks will take on the Nets on Sunday .
There is no doubt Giannis Antetokounmpo is having an All-Star season with the numbers he has been producing , as Monday 's 22 - point , 11 - rebound performance was his eighth double - double of the season and brought his season averages to 22 points , 9 rebounds and 6 assists per game . But perhaps the most overlooked stat of Antetokounmpo 's breakout season is his steal totals , which , after recording two in Monday 's loss to San Antonio , is now up to 2 per game . The Greek Freak has now managed to record at least two steals in his last four games and in five of his last seven . He has also had five games this season where he has gotten at least four steals and is currently behind only Chris Paul for the NBA lead in steals per game . So , while all eyes are on Antetokounmpo 's ability to fill up the box score on the offensive end , he is turning out to be just as effective of a player on the other side of the ball as well .
The Orlando Magic defeated the Washington Wizards , 124 - 116 , at Verizon Center on Tuesday . Just a few games ago , the Magic ( 10 - 12 ) were in the midst of a forgettable stretch where they lost five of six contests . However , after some tinkering with the starting five , they 've started to find the right balance and hit their stride . Never has that been more evident than Tuesday , when they exploded for a season - high point total . It was notably the second unit , which includes a pair of former starters in Elfrid Payton and Nikola Vucevic , that carried the night for Orlando , as they combined for a whopping 73 points . That superb effort helped overcome a herculean performance from the Wizards ' John Wall , who went for a season - high 52 points . Payton actually led the way for Orlando overall , posting a team - high 25 points and supplementing that total with nine assists , a rebound , three steals and three blocks over 35 minutes on the court . It was a season - high point total for the point guard , who 'd posted three straight single - digit scoring outings prior to Tuesday . The second - and third - highest scorers for the Magic were also on the second unit , with Jeff Green compiling 20 points , three rebounds and a steal . Jodie Meeks was next with 18 points , two rebounds and an assist in just 16 minutes off the bench . Bismack Biyombo posted a 14 - point , 13 - rebound double - double that also featured two assists and three blocks . Evan Fournier and Serge Ibaka registered a pair of 10 - point efforts , with the former posting three rebounds and an assist , and the latter supplying five rebounds , an assist and four blocks . Vucevic managed a 10 - point , 10 - rebound double - double on the second unit as well . Wall added eight assists , four rebounds and three steals to his game - high scoring haul . Bradley Beal was a distant second on the Wizards ( 7 - 13 ) with 19 points , three rebounds and three assists . Markieff Morris tallied 10 points , seven rebounds , two assists and a block . Otto Porter ( seven points ) and Marcin Gortat ( six points ) turned in modest offensive totals , but the latter did also haul in 11 rebounds , along with an assist , a steal and a block . Marcus Thornton led the second unit with a full stat line of eight points , five rebounds , three assists and a steal . The Magic head back home to face off with the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night , while the Wizards remain home to face the Denver Nuggets on Thursday evening .
The Boston Celtics defeated the Charlotte Hornets , 104 - 98 , at Spectrum Center on Saturday . Avery Bradley has long been renowned for his stingy defense and known as more of a complementary presence on the offensive side . It was vastly different story Saturday , however , as the veteran guard exploded for 31 points and a career - high 11 rebounds . The scoring total largely consisted of a personal - best eight three - pointers , and he and backcourt mate Isaiah Thomas combined for over half of Boston 's points on the night . They also helped the Celtics ( 2 - 1 ) tally a 48 percent success rate from the field , including a 48 percent figure from beyond the arc , with the latter number nearly doubling the Hornets ' ( 2 - 1 ) number . Bradley added four assists and a steal to his stellar stat line . Thomas contributed 24 points and added seven assists and a rebound . Al Horford supplied 14 points , four boards , three assists , two blocks and a steal , while Jae Crowder 's full stat line included nine points , nine rebounds , four assists , three blocks and two steals . Kemba Walker once again served as the linchpin of the Charlotte attack , which has been decidedly top - heavy so far this season . He posted 29 points , three assists , two rebounds and three steals . Nicolas Batum had his hands full all night on defense with Bradley and totaled a modest 12 points of his own , along with six assists , four rebounds and a pair of blocks . No other starter managed double - digit scoring , although Cody Zeller , starting at center , did haul in nine rebounds . Frank Kaminsky III paced the bench with 11 points . The Celtics head back home to take on the Bulls on Wednesday , while the Hornets face off with the Sixers in a home tilt Wednesday as well .
Nicolas Batum ( 28 points ) and Kemba Walker ( 20 points ) countered a 33 - point , 15 - rebound , eight - assist effort from Russell Westbrook . Michael Kidd-Gilchrist posted a 14 - point , 11 - rebound double - double and Marvin Williams also supplied eight points . Big men Frank Kaminsky III and Spencer Hawes made up for Cody Zeller 's absence with 17 and eight points , respectively , off the bench . Ramon Sessions and Jeremy Lamb also stepped up with a pair of nine efforts in reserve roles . The Hornets ' 46 and 38 percent tallies from the field and three - point range outpaced OKC 's corresponding 44 and 30 percent figures . After entering the fourth quarter with a slight 88 - 87 deficit , Charlotte outscored OKC 36 - 24 over the final 12 minutes . Victor Oladipo and Steven Adams had matching 18 - point efforts for the Thunder , while Enes Kanter went for 22 points in just 20 minutes .
The Toronto Raptors ( 29 - 15 ) recorded their eighth consecutive win Sunday with a 112 - 94 victory against the visiting Los Angeles Clippers ( 28 - 16 ) . Seven Raptors scored in double figures , led by Kyle Lowry 's 21 points , as Toronto moved to within one game of matching its franchise - long winning streak set in 2001 - 2 . Jonas Valanciunas added 20 and DeMar DeRozan had 18 points . Terrence Ross matched the latter with 18 off the bench as Toronto 's resevers came up big . Corey Joseph had 12 points while Patrick Patterson and Bismack Biyombo both scored 10 . Ross was 5 of 7 from three - point range to pace the reserves , who outscored the Clippers ' bench , 51 - 29 . The Raptors , who also took two games this season from the Lakers , swept the season season series from the Clippers , marking the first time in franchise history they have swept both Los Angeles teams in a season . Chris Paul totaled 23 points and 11 assists to lead the Clippers , who jumped to a 13 - point first - quarter advantage before faltering . DeAndre Jordan finished with 15 points and 13 rebounds while JJ Redick added 17 points . The Clippers ' bench , though , could n't match Toronto 's as the resevers were held to 39 percent shooting from the field , including 2 of 10 from three - point range .
The Sacramento Kings ( 9 - 5 ) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans ( 7 - 6 ) 99 - 89 on Tuesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans . Despite going into the half even at 49 points apiece , the Kings were able to out - score the Pelicans 50 - 40 in the second half to notch their third victory in as many games . The Kings were able to shoot 48 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three - point line to give them the advantage over the Pelicans , who shot 42 percent from the floor and only 18 percent from beyond the arc . Leading the Kings to the victory was the duo of DeMarcus Cousins and Omri Casspi . Cousins scored 22 points ( 8 - 18 FG , 6 - 6 FT ) , and grabbed 12 rebounds , giving him his seventh straight double - double and eleventh on the year . Casspi was in the starting lineup for the first time this season with Rudy Gay sitting out with an Achilles injury . He shot 9 - for - 14 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score 22 points in 36 minutes . He 's only averaging 7 points in 18 minutes per game this season , so the boost in playing time allowed him to surprise many with the dominant performance . Ramon Sessions was also a replacement in the starting lineup , as Darren Collison was out with a quad injury . Sessions also took advantage of the start and recorded 15 points and six assists . Coming off the bench , Ray McCallum had 12 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) in 19 minutes . For the Pelicans , Anthony Davis was n't his normal self tonight . He struggled to post the monster line he 's become accustomed to this season , as he shot only 4 - for - 12 from the field to finish with 14 points and nine rebounds . His output was well below his season averages of 26 points and 11 rebounds . Tyreke Evans played well on the other hand . He scored 22 points ( 10 - 17 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 4 FT ) and added seven rebounds and five assists . The 22 points matched a season - high for Evans . Ryan Anderson was really the only other big contributor in the loss . He shot 7 - for - 14 from the field and 3 - for - 7 from beyond the arc to score 20 points . It was n't enough of a boost to beat a tough Sacramento team though . The Kings ' next game will be on the road against the Houston Rockets on Wednesday , while the Pelicans will travel to Atlanta to play the Hawks on Friday .
The Cavaliers ( 43 - 25 ) defeated the Magic ( 21 - 47 ) 123 - 108 in Orlando on Sunday . Down 28 - 26 at the end of the first quarter , Cleveland took the lead 12 seconds into the second quarter and never looked back . Kyrie Irving led the team in scoring , following up his career - high 57 point performance against the Spurs on Thursday with 33 points ( 12 - 15 FG , 5 - 6 3Pt ) , four rebounds , four assists and one steal in 35 minutes .

James continues to make his case for the MVP Award while allowing Irving to shine as well . The Cavaliers are locked into second place in the Eastern Conference playoff standings , sitting 10 games behind the East-leading Atlanta Hawks , a chasm the Cavs are unlikely to be able to close with just 14 games left on the schedule for them this season . Up next , the Cavaliers hit the road against the Heat on Monday . The Magic will play the Rockets in Houston on Tuesday .
The Cavaliers ( 50 - 27 ) defeated the Bulls ( 46 - 31 ) 99 - 94 on Sunday at Quicken Loans Arena . Cleveland went into halftime with a 10 - point lead , bolstered by a spectacular J.R.

The Toronto Raptors ( 46 - 32 ) defeated the Charlotte Hornets ( 33 - 45 ) 92 - 74 on Wednesday in Charlotte . The Raptors were dominant Monday night from start to finish , and while late in the fourth quarter it appeared as if the Hornets were looking to make one last push , Toronto had little trouble closing it out . DeMar DeRozan led the way for Toronto , scoring 18 points ( 6 - 16 FG , 6 - 7 FT ) , to go along with seven assists and three blocks in 31 minutes . Lou Williams provided solid scoring off the bench , putting up 16 points ( 5 - 15 FG , 3 - 8 3Pt ) in 26 minutes . Despite their performances , the two still shot rather poorly , going a combined 11 - of - 31 from the field . Greivis Vasquez got the start once again with Lowry continuing to sit out with a back injury , and he matched Williams ' 16 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 4 - 6 3Pt ) , while also recording five rebounds and four assists in 36 minutes . Amir Johnson missed his second consecutive game . Tyler Hansbrough got the start and logged a double - double with 12 points and 12 rebounds in 37 minutes . With the win , Toronto tied the Chicago Bulls for third place in the Eastern Conference , although the Raptors own the tie breaker so they currently sit above them . The Hornets struggled to get anything going Monday night . Kemba Walker was the only starter who scored in double figures with 15 points ( 5 - 13 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt ) , to go along with four rebounds and just three assists . The only other Charlotte players to score in double figures were the team 's two point guards off the bench , with Mo Williams and Brian Roberts each scoring 10 points on a combined 8 - of - 20 shooting . As a team , Charlotte shot a dreadful 35 percent percent from the field , and the loss really hurts their playoff chances , as they are now three games behind the Celtics for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East . Up next , the Raptors will travel to Orlando on Friday and play the Magic , while the Hornets will head to Atlanta Friday to take on the East-leading Hawks .
The Los Angeles Lakers ( 14 - 41 ) defeated the Boston Celtics ( 20 - 33 ) 118 - 111 in overtime on Sunday . Los Angeles took the win to tie the season series with Boston 1 - 1 . The win also helped end the Lakers ' seven - game losing streak that stretched back to Feb. 1 . Jeremy Lin was the catalyst Sunday , finishing with a team - high 25 points in 30 minutes off the bench . Four bench players finished with double - digit points , as coach Byron Scott turned to his reserves to lead the way . The Celtics have dropped two straight , but they did enjoy a nice debut performance from Isaiah Thomas . He finished with 21 points in 25 minutes off the bench before getting ejected for arguing an offensive foul call made against him with five minutes left in the fourth quarter . Jae Crowder lead the rally back in the fourth to push the game to overtime , but it was Avery Bradley who hit a three - pointer as time expired to send the game into the extra period . Lin was a part of every scoring play in overtime , dishing out three assists in the additional five minutes and scoring four points . Los Angeles will travel to Utah to play the Jazz on Wednesday , and the Celtics will wrap up their road trip in Phoenix on Monday .
The Golden State Warriors defeated the visiting Oklahoma City Thunder , 120 - 111 , in Game 5 of the Western Conference finals at Oracle Arena on Thursday . The Thunder lead the series , 3 - 2 . The Warriors had their backs against the wall after losing Games 3 and 4 in Oklahoma City , but it’s a different game when your back is against the wall in your house . Oracle Arena was one of the toughest arenas to win in all season long for the opposition , and Golden State got back on track , ran their offense , found their stroke from behind the arc and held off a hungry Thunder team . Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook did not make it an easy nine point win for the defending champions , as both players combined for 71 points and simply would not quit down double figures late in the fourth quarter . The first half went in favor of Golden State , as the small ball lineup returned to form behind Draymond Green’s physical play and an improved rebounding effort from the Michigan State product and his Australian counterpart , Andrew Bogut . The Thunder went into the half down eight points , but Durant went to another level by attacking the rim possession after possession and willed his way to the free throw line . Durant finished a perfect 13 - of - 13 from the charity stripe . Three of those free throws came late in the fourth quarter , as the Thunder were on the brink of trimming a 10 point Warriors lead to five points . The all - star forward was fouled behind the arc by Harrison Barnes , and drained all his free throws . Stephen Curry then turned the ball over , Russell Westbrook drove the lane and got himself an and - 1 , missed the free throw off the front of the rim , recovered the rebound and saw Durant at the three - point line . Durant happened to miss the needed trey , and the Warriors were able to close out the rest of the game . The sequence of events proved the Thunder are at their hungriest and were not going down in Golden State without an intense fight . Westbrook finished with 31 points , seven rebounds , eight rebounds , five steals and seven turnovers , while Durant topped off the scoring column with 40 points . Serge Ibaka has resurged himself in this series , and added 13 points and eight boards . Golden State was led by Curry and Thompson , as the backcourt combined for 58 points , 12 rebounds , eight assists and six steals ( five of which were Curry’s ) , on 17 - of - 41 shooting . Draymond Green stuffed the stat sheet to the tune of 11 points , 13 rebounds , four assists and four blocks on 4 - of - 10 shooting , and added his best defense of the series when the Warriors needed it most . Game 6 will return to Oklahoma City on Saturday .
The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the visiting Memphis Grizzlies 114 - 102 , at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Friday evening . The Grizzlies led by four after three quarters , but then Russell Westbrook went absolutely ballistic in the fourth quarter , scoring 19 points in the quarter , including 15 points straight and unanswered , to take his team from down 102 - 99 to the final score of 114 - 102 . This snaps the Grizzlies three - game win streak , while Westbrook added to his ridiculous triple - double count , as he notched his 25th of the season . The Thunder ( 29 - 22 ) only scored 21 points in the first quarter , before outscoring the Grizz by 12 in the second , to take an eight - point lead into half time . They were then outscored by 12 in the third , and entered the fourth down by four . The Thunder outscored the Grizz by 14 in the fourth , behind Russell Westbrook and his takeover . Westbrook finished with 38 points , 13 rebounds , 12 assists and three steals to lead his squad to a big win . Westbrook also matched a career - best as he went 17 - of - 17 from the foul line . Three other players scored in double digits for the Thunder , including Steven Adams and Joffrey Lauvergne , who pitched in 16 points each . The Thunder go on to visit Portland on Sunday . Meanwhile , the Grizzlies ( 30 - 22 ) saw their win streak come to an end as they went scoreless in the last 2:50 as they were stifled by an overwhelming push of energy and intensity from the Thunder and their home crowd . Marc Gasol finished with a team - high 31 points , to go along with eight assists , four rebounds , two steals and one block , in 42 minutes . Zach Randolph came up big in 29 minutes off the bench , with 16 points and 10 rebounds , while Mike Conley chipped in 18 points , three steals and two assists . Chandler Parsons added 12 points on 3 - of - 6 shooting , in 25 minutes . The Grizzlies will have to put this one in the past , as they go right back in action on Saturday , when they visit Minnesota to take on the Timberwolves .
The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers , 121 - 120 , Monday night at Staples Center . In a game of runs , the game came down to who could make their free throws in the closing moments , with the Clippers ( 18 - 7 ) converting on just enough of their free throw attempts to hold off the Trail Blazers ( 12 - 14 ) , who refused to go away , in the end . Fresh off his 20 - point , 20 - assist performance Saturday against the Pelicans , Chris Paul put together yet another impressive double - double , posting 21 points and 14 assists in 36 minutes . Blake Griffin led the way scoring for Los Angeles after missing the last game with knee soreness , posting 26 points , 12 rebounds and six assists . As a team , the Clippers were lethal from downtown , shooting 48 percent from long range . The Trail Blazers , however , were equally hot from behind the arc , shooting 48 percent themselves from three - point land . Regardless , they still fell a point short despite putting up an equally impressive performance overall . Their starting backcourt consisting of Damian Lillard and C.J . McCollum combined to score 49 points , while starting center Mason Plumlee put together his best performance of the 2016 - 17 season , posting 18 points , seven rebounds , six assists and five blocks . Plumlee 's performance put him in the same company as both Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo as the only three players to post such a stat line . Up next , the Clippers will head to Orlando Wednesday to take on the Magic , while the Trail Blazers will head home Tuesday and play the Thunder .
The Miami Heat defeated the Indiana Pacers , 95 - 89 , at American Airlines Arena on Wednesday . While these are teams that have n't quite lived up to expectations this season , they left it all on the floor here . Miami turned on the defense in the fourth quarter , as they held the Pacers to just 10 points en route to a comeback win . Indiana struggled all night from the field though , as they hit just 37 percent of their shots . Rebounding was huge for the Heat , as they won that battle , 58 - 38 . In addition , Miami recorded 23 assists , while holding the Pacers to just 14 . There were nine ties and 14 lead changes , as neither team led by more than seven points . Indiana ( 13 - 13 ) has been a bit of a disappointment this season and losses like this only add to the skepticism . Paul George struggled from the field , as he accumulated 22 points , seven rebounds and three assists on 8 - of - 22 shooting . C.J . Miles was second on the team , as he dropped 15 points off the bench . Myles Turner had a nice all - around game , amassing 11 points , seven rebounds , two assists and five blocks in the defeat . The Pacers will look to play better on Friday in a road matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans . Miami ( 9 - 17 ) has not had the results they want this year , but they continue to play well and wins like this only confirm that point . Hassan Whiteside was the player of the game , as he totaled 26 points and 22 rebounds on 10 - of - 16 shooting . Goran Dragic was the only other starter in double figures , as he tallied 11 points , five rebounds and six assists . The bench was huge , as Josh Richardson , Tyler Johnson and James Johnson all scored in double figures . Tyler Johnson finished with 15 points , five rebounds , three assists and four blocks , while James Johnson accrued 14 points , three rebounds and six assists . On deck for the Heat is a home matchup against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday .
The Memphis Grizzlies ( 30 - 12 ) defeated the Toronto Raptors ( 27 - 15 ) 92 - 86 on Wednesday . After losing the teams ' first matchup on Nov. 19 , the Grizzlies found a way to close the season series between these teams with a win . Marc Gasol lead the way with a game - high 26 points to go with seven rebounds and five assists in 35 minutes . His frontcourt compatriot , Zach Randolph , finished with a double - double of his own , posting 19 points and 13 rebounds in 36 minutes . The Grizzlies won a rough game by holding the Raptors to 32 percent shooting from the field and 18 percent shooting from beyond the arc . Jeff Green moved into the starting lineup , replacing Courtney Lee , but Green struggled , posting just six points and two rebounds in 26 minutes . Toronto scored 24 points off of 13 turnovers , but it was n't enough to overcome their deficiencies on offense . Kyle Lowry dislocated the ring finger on his right hand , but after a brief time in the locker room , he returned , finishing with a team - high 20 points to go with eight rebounds and three assists in 40 minutes . All-Star shooting guard , DeMar DeRozan was not himself , putting up just six points on 2 - for - 11 shooting from the field in 33 minutes . After starting the season on a 24 - 7 run , the Raptors have regressed , putting together a woeful 3 - 8 record since Dec. 30 . The Grizzlies will fire up the barbecue for a matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers at home on Saturday , and the Raptors will rub down the meat when they play the 76ers on Friday in Philadelphia .
The Los Angeles Lakers ( 8 - 16 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 5 - 18 ) 100 - 94 on Sunday . Los Angeles has strung together three straight wins with their new starting lineup . Ironically enough , most of their success can be pointed to the improved play of their bench since Jeremy Lin and Carlos Boozer were moved into reserve roles . Taking Boozer and Lin out of the starting lineup allows Kobe Bryant to operate unecumbered as the loan dominant offensive player in the starting lineup while giving Lin and Boozer possessions off the bench that do n't require Bryant to force his touches . Boozer led the Lakers on Sunday with a bygone double - double of 22 points and 13 rebounds in 27 minutes . The Lakers will look to continue their recent success when they take on the woeful Indiana Pacers on Monday . Bryant 's 26 points vaulted him over Michael Jordan in career points to land at third all - time for the NBA scoring record . Minnesota has lost two straight games , but wins and losses are no longer the focus of the Timberwolves ' season as president Flip Saunders told the media this week that the team 's focus is now on rebuilding for the future , a path Saunders did not plan to walk down this season . However , with Ricky Rubio ( ankle ) , Kevin Martin ( wrist ) and Nikola Pekovic ( wrist ) all expected to miss as much as another month of action , Minnesota 's hopes of competing for a playoff spot this season were dashed . They 'll embark on a two - game road trip Tuesday in Washington against the Wizards .
James Harden scored 34 points , but it wasn’t enough to overcome a fourth quarter run by Golden State , as the Rockets fell 105 - 93 on Wednesday . Playing without Dwight Howard , as well as a number of other key reserves , Houston shot 42 percent from the floor and 9 - of - 35 from beyond the arc . The offense relied heavily on Harden , who converted 14 - of - 27 field goals and 3 - of - 8 three - pointers to go with eight rebounds , four assists and four steals . Patrick Beverley added 12 points , while Donatas Motiejunas and Trevor Ariza ( 5 - 14 FG , 4 - 12 3Pt ) each had 18 . Golden State , winners of 14 straight , maintained its grasp on the league’s best record behind 20 points , seven rebounds and seven assists from Stephen Curry . Klay Thompson added 21 points despite converting just 1 - of - 8 three - point attempts , and Harrison Barnes chipped in 20 points and seven rebounds of his own . Starting in place of the injured Andrew Bogut , Festus Ezeli had seven points and three rebounds in 16 minutes . The road ahead doesn’t get any easier for Golden State , which takes on the Mavericks on Saturday . Following that matchup , New Orleans , Memphis , Oklahoma City and Sacramento await on the schedule . Houston , meanwhile , plays in Sacramento Thursday night . Howard is not expected to play and hopes to return for Saturday’s game against Denver .
The Chicago Bulls defeated the Boston Celtics , 104 - 103 , at United Center on Thursday . In the final game before the All-Star break , these two teams left it all on the floor . In fact , there were eight ties and 14 lead changes , with neither team leading by more than 10 points . Jimmy Butler was the hero , as he hit two clutch free - throws with less than a second left to seal the win . Free-throw shooting was a key for Chicago all night , as they went a perfect 22 - of - 22 from the free - throw line . Rebounding was the decisive statistic though , with the Bulls winning that differential , 51 - 31 . The Celtics ( 37 - 20 ) have been one of the hottest teams over recent weeks , but they 'll head into the All-Star break with a devastating loss . Isaiah Thomas led the team once again , as he tallied 29 points , three rebounds and seven assists . No other starter had more than 10 points , with Marcus Smart , Al Horford and Jae Crowder combining to go 7 - of - 22 from the field . Kelly Olynyk came off the bench to provide 17 points , seven rebounds and four assists . The Bulls ( 28 - 29 ) are slowly climbing back to .500 and this win may be what they need to go on a run over the final couple months . Jimmy Butler led the way , as he accumulated 29 points , four rebounds and seven assists . Bobby Portis finished second on the team , collecting 19 points and eight rebounds off the bench . Robin Lopez fell just shy of a double - double , totaling 15 points and eight rebounds . Rajon Rondo had a strange line , as he went scoreless , but grabbed seven rebounds and dished out eight assists off the bench .
The Mavericks ( 25 - 10 ) handled the LeBron-less Cavaliers ( 19 - 15 ) 109 - 90 on Sunday in Cleveland . The Mavericks scorched the nets to the tune of 56 percent shooting and converted 12 - of - 26 three - point field goals .

Kyrie Irving , who finished with six points in 25 minutes , departed the game in the second half due to lower back soreness and did not return . Cleveland shot just 41 percent from the field and converted 8 - of - 25 three - pointers . Up next , Cleveland travels to Philadelphia to take on the 76ers on Monday . Dallas heads east to Brooklyn to take on the Nets , also on Monday .
The Chicago Bulls ( 49 - 32 ) defeated the Brooklyn Nets ( 37 - 44 ) 113 - 86 on Monday . Nikola Mirotic came off the bench to lead the Bulls with 26 points in 24 minutes . He has continued to impress when he gets the chance to play . In March he averaged 21 points , 8 rebounds and 1 blocks in 31 minutes a game . He was putting up 10 points and 5 rebounds in April , coming into Monday 's game . His role was increased against Brooklyn because Joakim Noah sat out with a knee injury . Taj Gibson also saw an uptick in minutes . He jumped into the starting lineup at power forward for the Bulls , as Pau Gasol was moved to center . Gibson had 15 points , nine rebounds and four blocked shots . Gasol had a dominant all - around performance with 22 points , 11 rebounds , four assists and two blocks against a hot Brook Lopez . Chicago has the night off on Tuesday and will host the number one seed in the Eastern Conference , the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday . The Bulls will either be the number two or number three seed . On their off - day Tuesday , they can watch the Toronto Raptors , who they are currently battling for the second seed with . The Nets ran into a tough Bull 's defense and had a hard time getting their starters points . Lopez lead the Bulls with 13 points to go along with eight rebounds , but he would 've liked to have a better game with Noah out of the lineup . Jarrett Jack and Bojan Bogdanovic combined for 32 points off the bench but it was n't nearly enough as Chicago took it too the Nets in a 30 - 15 third quarter to add to the seven point lead they already had at halftime . This loss dropped the Nets out of the eighth seed in the playoffs for the time being . The Indiana Pacers had off Monday , as they slipped into the eighth seed with the Brooklyn 's loss . The Nets will host the Orlando Magic on Wednesday as they hope for a playoff birth .
The shorthanded Memphis Grizzlies ( 38 - 25 ) shocked the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 44 - 18 ) in a 106 - 103 win on Monday . Memphis was projected to lose by 10 with all their regulars , but won this game with all those players sitting . That spread skyrocketed to 15 points once it was announced that Memphis would be without Zach Randolph , Marc Gasol , Mike Conley and Matt Barnes for this game . The backups somehow pulled out a miraculous win , thanks to forcing the Cavaliers to commit 25 turnovers , while committing just 16 of their own . Memphis started off hot , as they scored 33 points in the first quarter to take an eight - point lead . Memphis got some heroic performances tonight in a showcase win . Tony Allen was especially good , as he tallied 26 points , four assists and five steals in the win for the third - highest point total of his career . Mario Chalmers filled in for Mike Conley admirably , as he accumulated 17 points , seven assists , four rebounds and four steals . JaMychal Green totaled 16 points , 10 rebounds , six assists and four steals of his own . Lance Stephenson gave the team a nice spark off the bench as well , as he scored 17 points and snatched down seven rebounds in the victory . On deck for the Grizzlies is a matchup against the Boston Celtics on Wednesday . This was arguably the worst loss of the season for Cleveland and there will surely be plenty spoken about this bad defeat . LeBron James was one of the few motivated players , as he tallied 28 points , nine rebounds and five assists in the loss . Kyrie Irving also played well , as he amassed 28 points , five assists and four steals . The Cavaliers start a four - game West Coast trip on Wednesday against the Sacramento Kings in their next matchup .
Anthony Davis ' standout effort ( 31 points , 16 boards , two assists , two blocks ) and a 53 - point contribution from the Pelicans bench helped them secure a 15 - point road win . New Orleans ' three - point shooting was particularly impressive , as they tallied a 59 percent success rate from behind the arc . Terrence Jones was New Orleans ' second - leading scorer , posting a 17 - point , 10 - rebound double - double . E'Twaun Moore supplied 15 points off the bench . Jrue Holiday tallied a modest 12 points , nine assists and four rebounds , although he shot just 4 - of - 14 from the field . Buddy Hield drew the start and poured in 10 points . Reserve big man Ersan Ilyasova led the Sixers in scoring , totaling 14 points , four rebounds and a block . Gerald Henderson managed 13 points , and Jahlil Okafor , Joel Embiid and Robert Covington turned in a trio of 11 - point efforts .
The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in overtime , 114 - 108 , at Moda Center on Thursday . Despite Portland being a huge favorite headed in , this took an extra session to decide a winner . The Blazers actually led for the majority of the game , as they held the lead for well over 40 minutes and never allowed the Sixers to lead by more than four points . Rebounding was the difference in the game , with Portland winning that battle , 55 - 44 . They also dominated the assist differential , recording 25 assists to Philadelphia 's 18 . Another key for the Trail Blazers was their ability to draw fouls , as they went 28 - of - 33 from the free - throw line , while the Sixers took just 20 attempts . The Sixers ( 23 - 41 ) have really struggled without Joel Embiid ( knee ) , as they 've lost six of their last seven games . Dario Saric continued his Rookie of the Year campaign though , as he led the team with 28 points , nine rebounds and two steals on 11 - of - 16 shooting . Robert Covington finished second on the team , totaling 24 points , 13 rebounds , two assists and two steals . Jahlil Okafor amassed 16 points and eight rebounds . On deck for the Sixers is a road matchup with the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday . The Blazers ( 28 - 35 ) continue to battle for the eight - seed in the West , as this victory brought them within a game of the Denver Nuggets . Jusuf Nurkic was a beast , as he led the team with 28 points , 20 rebounds , eight assists and six blocks . Damian Lillard finished with 24 points , four rebounds and four assists . C.J . McCollum accumulated 23 points , four rebounds and three assists . Allen Crabbe was the lone player to score in double figures off the bench , as he provided 18 points off the pine . The Blazers will look to keep rolling on Saturday against the Washington Wizards .
The Chicago Bulls ( 30 ) outlasted the Milwaukee Bucks ( 0 - 3 ) in double overtime Thursday , 113 - 106 , at the BMO Harris Bradley Center . The Bucks had a .6 % win probability with 2:0 minutes remaining in the fourth as they trailed by eight points . Milwaukee did n't look like the team that had an 18 - point lead earlier in the game as Derrick Rose and Tony Snell had started to take over for Chicago . The Bucks turned to Khris Middleton , who scored eight of Milwaukee 's final nine points to force overtime . After the Bulls and Bucks traded baskets in the first overtime period , the Bulls ' began to pull away in the second overtime . Milwaukee 's offense sputtered out and began turning the ball over at an alarming rate , failing to register its first point of the second overtime until the final minute . Derrick Rose delivered a huge performance to lead the Bulls to victory with 34 points and eight assists over 48 minutes . The Bulls will look to close out the series Saturday in Milwaukee . Chicago survived Milwaukee 's massive momentum towards the end of regulation to gain a three - game advantage in this best of seven series . Along with Rose 's tremendous effort , Pau Gasol turned in another double - double with 17 points and 14 rebounds . Tony Snell was key off the bench with 16 points , nine of which came on three three pointers in the fourth quarter . The Bulls are now poised to take a series sweep over the Bucks , but if Thursday 's game is any indication , they will be in for a battle in Game 4 . Milwaukee 's young nucleus turned in a strong performance Thursday against a more battle tested Chicago club . Giannis Antetokounmpo started off strong with 17 first half points and finished with 25 to go with 12 rebounds over 51 minutes on the floor . John Henson had a huge game off the bench with 15 points , 14 rebounds , and three blocks as he filled in ably for a struggling Zaza Pachulia . The Bucks will look to extend the series Saturday on their home floor and avoid a sweep against their division rival .
Marc Gasol and Mike Conley combined for 52 points , exactly half of the Grizzlies ' scoring total , with each logging a whopping 45 minutes . The former posted 27 points , while the latter had a near triple - double with 25 points , nine rebounds and nine assists . JaMychal Green managed a 10 - point , 11 - rebound double - double and veteran Zach Randolph led the reserves with 11 points , six rebounds , an assist , two blocks and a steal . The Sixers were led by Ersan Ilyasova , who supplied a 22 - point , 12 - rebound double - double before fouling out after 40 minutes . Robert Covington and Joel Embiid made it three - for - three in the double - double department for the first unit , with respective 19 - point , 12 - rebound and 12 - point , 11 - rebound tallies . Jerryd Bayless paced the second unit with 18 points , while Nik Stauskas scored 10 points in a robust 40 minutes off the bench .
The San Antonio Spurs ( 18 - 11 ) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers ( 19 - 9 ) 125 - 118 on Monday at the AT & T Center in San Antonio . The Spurs seemingly could not miss in this game , as they finished at 64 percent from the field and 56 percent from the three - point line . The Clippers shot decent at 50 percent from the field and 43 percent from beyond the arc , but it was n't enough to keep up with the electric Spurs team . The Spurs were led by Tony Parker , who shot 11 - for - 18 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 26 points , while also adding four assists . It was Parker 's first game in over week after dealing with a hamstring injury , and he came back firing with a huge night on the offensive side of the ball . Tim Duncan also had a strong showing , scoring 21 points and recording 12 rebounds . It was his third double - double in a row , as he 's averaged 25 points and 13 rebounds over those three games . The Spurs also had a lot of help off the bench from both Manu Ginobili and Boris Diaw . Ginobili finished with 19 points ( 7 - 11 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and 10 assists , while Diaw recorded 23 points ( 9 - 11 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 3 - 8 FT ) and six rebounds . With that kind of production , the Spurs may be impossible to beat . Despite a ridiculous shooting performance from the Spurs , the Clippers kept it close with Blake Griffin , JJ Redick and Chris Paul all scoring over 20 points . Paul led the way with 25 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 3 - 6 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) and nine assists . Over the last two games he 's combined for 52 points and 18 rebounds , as he 's stayed hot on the offensive side of the ball .

Griffin did a little bit of everything in this one , pushing his season averages to 23 points , 8 rebounds and 4 assists per game . Redick shot 6 - for - 13 from the field and 5 - for - 8 from beyond the arc to score 25 points . It was his second game in a row scoring over 20 points , despite averaging only 15 points on the year . Jamal Crawford also played well , scoring 18 points ( 6 - 15 FG , 0 - 5 3Pt , 6 - 6 FT ) off the bench . The Spurs ' next game will be at home against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday , while the Clippers will travel to Atlanta to play the Hawks on Tuesday .
The Chicago Bulls ( 38 - 23 ) defeated the Washington Wizards 104 - 96 ( 24 - 27 ) on Tuesday in Chicago . The Bulls , despite dealing with injuries to Derrick Rose ( knee ) , Jimmy Butler ( elbow ) , and Taj Gibson ( ankle ) , were able to pull out a win against a struggling Wizards team . The Bulls were led by rookie Nikola Mirotic , who had a game - high 23 points on 6 - of - 13 shooting and eight rebounds in 32 minutes off the bench . In his last two games , Mirotic has totaled 52 points and 17 rebounds and has proven to be a viable option off the bench in place of Gibson . Chicago 's starting frontcourt of Paul Gasol and Joakim Noah each posted double - doubles . Gasol had 20 points on 8 - of - 11 shooting and 10 rebounds , while Noah recorded 14 points on 4 - of - 5 shooting and 12 rebounds . Aaron Brooks got the start in place of Rose and while he shot an unimpressive 8 - of - 23 from the field , Brooks still finished with 22 points and eight assists in 35 minutes . Tony Snell got the start for Butler but posted just 11 points on 4 - of - 12 shooting in 40 minutes . The Bulls shot 42 percent from the field and had 16 turnovers to just 20 assists . John Wall struggled shooting the ball ( 8 - of - 20 from the field ) but still managed to put up 21 points , 11 assists and four rebounds in 39 minutes . Marcin Gortat recorded 12 points on 6 - of - 9 shooting and 12 rebounds . The effort was his second straight double - double and his sixth straight game with double - digit rebounds . Paul Pierce ( 16 ) , Bradley Beal ( 13 ) , and Otto Poter Jr. ( 11 ) rounded out the Washington players in double figures . As a team , the Wizards shot 42 percent from the field and were active defensively , recording 11 blocks and 10 steals . Up next , the Bulls will stay home to take on the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday , while the Wizards head home Friday to take on Miami .
The Miami Heat defeated the Brooklyn Nets , 108 - 99 , at Barclays Center on Friday . The two teams came into Friday 's contest as polar opposites , with the Heat ( 24 - 30 ) looking to tally their 13th consecutive victory and the Nets ( 9 - 45 ) trying to avoid a 12th straight defeat . Brooklyn 's one ray of hope was the fact that they 'd notched seven of their nine wins on the season at home , and perhaps the more intangible factor of the odds eventually favoring a Miami loss and Brooklyn victory , given their respective extended streaks . However , as usual , the Nets could n't hang on to the ball with any degree of consistency , significantly undermining their chances . The home team committed 22 turnovers overall , while also getting outscored 59 - 46 in the second half . The Heat bench compiled 56 points overall , with James Johnson scoring a team - high 26 , and adding eight rebounds , two assists , three blocks and a steal . Goran Dragic was next with 21 points , five assists , four rebounds and one steal . Tyler Johnson totaled 18 points , six rebounds , two assists and three steals . Rodney McGruder chipped in with 11 points , six rebounds , three assists and four steals . Okaro White supplied 10 points , five boards and one assist in 31 minutes as a reserve . Wayne Ellington drew the start for Dion Waiters ( ankle ) and went for nine points , four rebounds , two assists and one steal , and Hassan Whiteside had a quiet game despite the appealing matchup , posting eight points , nine boards , one steal and four blocks . Brook Lopez 's 30 points led Brooklyn , a total he supplemented with eight rebounds , one assist and two blocks . Randy Foye tallied 15 points , one rebound and two assists . Bojan Bogdanovic was the third and final member of the Nets with double - digit scoring , collecting 10 points and six rebounds . Caris LeVert submitted a bench - leading nine points along with three rebounds and one assist . Trevor Booker was productive as a reserve as well , managing eight points , hauling in 10 boards and dishing out one assist . The Heat next head to Philadelphia to tangle with the Sixers on Saturday night , while the Nets remain home to face off with the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night .
The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Boston Celtics 128 - 122 on Thursday at Quicken Loans Arena . The score indicates a closer game than it actually was , as after the Cavaliers ( 50 ) took a 17 - point lead headed into the final period , the Celtics ( 3 - 2 ) came roaring back to at least make the game interesting , but six points was as close as they were going to get . After being rather passive scoring - wise through the first four games of the regular season , LeBron James exploded going for a game - high 30 points on top of 12 assists and seven rebounds in 36 minutes . The other two members of Cleveland 's big three also put together big nights , with Kevin Love recording 26 points and eight rebounds , as he continues his hot start to the season , and Kyrie Irving scoring 23 points of his own . As a team , the Cavaliers managed to do plenty of damage from behind the arc — where they shot 41 percent from — and the free throw line — where they shot an incredible 37 shots from , making 32 of them . Boston , on the other hand , came into this game missing both Jae Crowder ( ankle ) and Al Horford ( concussion ) and were carried by their starting backcourt consisting of Isaiah Thomas and Avery Bradley . Thomas recorded a game - high 30 points while scoring nearly half of his points from the free throw line , as he shot 14 - of - 14 from the charity stripe . The rest of his Boston teammates struggled getting to the line , however , as they shot just 5 - of - 8 from the stripe over the course of Thursday 's game . Bradley was n't too far behind , recording a double - double of 26 points and 10 rebounds over 39 minutes . It was rookie Jaylen Brown , however , who had the game 's breakout performance , scoring a career - high 19 points and grabbing five rebounds after getting the start in place of the injured Crowder . Up next , the Cavaliers will head to Philadelphia on Saturday to take on the 76ers , while the Celtics will have off until Sunday when they will take on the Nuggets .
The Denver Nuggets ( 8 - 13 ) won their second straight close game , defeating the Philadelphia 76ers ( 1 - 20 ) 108 - 105 on Saturday . Down 59 - 52 at the half , the Nuggets flipped the switch in the fourth quarter , outscoring the Sixers 30 - 19 in the final period to secure their second consecutive victory . In a game featuring two of the more permeable frontcourts in the league , Denver outrebounded Philadelphia 47 to 40 and outscored them in the paint , 44 to 34 . The Sixers were further weakened up front by the absence of standout rookie Jahlil Okafor , who was serving the second game of a team - imposed two - game suspension for recent off - the - court issues . Danilo Gallinari , as he has often done this season , spearheaded the Nuggets ' offensive attack with a 24 - point , seven - rebound performance , his second consecutive game over the 20 - point mark . The visitors also got a strong outing off the bench from Will Barton , who is certainly in contention for the Sixth Man of the Year award at this point . Barton contributed 16 points , and added nine rebounds , an assist and a steal over 33 minutes to come in second behind Gallinari in team scoring . For the starters , Randy Foye turned in another solid start in place of Gary Harris , notching 11 points , five rebounds , an assist and a steal . Rookie Emmanuel Mudiay only shot 33 percent but managed to pitch in 10 points , six assists , five rebounds and a steal . He did commit seven turnovers , underscoring an area of his game he must continue to focus on . Kenneth Faried came off the bench for 22 minutes and was a rebound shy of a double - double , pouring in 12 points and hauling in nine boards . Jameer Nelson was the third Denver player to manage double - digit points in a reserve role , posting 10 points , three assists and a pair of rebounds . Denver improved to 8 - 13 but remains in last place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They head home for a date with the Orlando Magic on Tuesday . The Sixers turned in a valiant effort without Okafor , but could n't hold on to the lead in the second half . All five starters notably turned in double - digit scoring performances , led by Robert Covington 's 18 - point , 10 - rebound double - double . The starting backcourt duo of Isaiah Canaan and T.J. McConnell were also solid contributors , tallying 15 and 10 points , respectively . McConnell in particular stuffed the stat sheet by adding eight rebounds , six assists and three steals . Nerlens Noel ( 14 points , five rebounds , two blocks ) and Jerami Grant ( 10 points , two assists , a rebound , four steals and a pair of blocks ) pitched in all over the court as well . Jakarr Sampson ( 13 points ) and Richaun Holmes ( 10 points ) also got in on the act from the bench , making it one of the best team efforts for Philadelphia in what has been a miserable campaign to date . The Sixers fell to 1 - 20 and remain last in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They are home for a tough matchup versus the San Antonio Spurs on Monday .
The San Antonio Spurs ( 62 - 12 ) picked up a road win over the Memphis Grizzlies ( 41 - 33 ) despite resting many of their top players Wednesday night at FedExForum , 101 - 87 . Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili were both inactive , and David West , Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker all sat out as the Spurs continue to get their bodies rested for the postseason . Still , with the Grizzlies missing Marc Gasol , Mike Conley , Zach Randolph and P.J . Hairston to injuries , the Spurs faced little resistance as they took an 8 - point lead into halftime and led by double - digits for the entire fourth quarter . LaMarcus Aldridge was San Antonio 's lone star in the lineup , and he dominated the game , scoring a game - high 31 points ( 11 - 16 FG , 9 - 11 FT ) and grabbing a game - high 13 rebounds ( four offensive ) . Patty Mills ( 7 - 10 FG , 3 - 4 3PT ) added 17 points in 22 minutes off the bench . The Spurs shot a robust 51 percent from the field as Memphis 's depleted front line offered little resistance inside . Vince Carter was Memphis 's leading scorer as he managed 14 points ( 3 - 9 FG , 2 - 3 3PT , 6 - 7 FT ) in 21 minutes off the bench . Jeff Green 's 12 points ( 5 - 9 FG ) led Memphis 's starters as the toll of playing through the Grizzlie 's myriad injuries is showing . Memphis managed just 40 percent from the field and committed 14 turnovers against just 19 assists as the reserves continue to have trouble producing offense . Memphis has now shot better than 50 percent from the field just once in its past 16 games . The Grizzlies remain at home for a Wednesday matchup against Denver . The Spurs return home to host the Pelicans on Wednesday .
The Portland Trail Blazers ( 11 - 3 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 0 - 14 ) 114 - 104 on Monday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia . Despite taking a 52 - 50 lead into halftime , the Sixers came out of the half cold and were out - scored by the Blazers 39 - 28 in the third quarter , allowing them to coast to the 10 - point victory . The Sixers big men also struggled with the Blazers ' bigs , as they were out - rebounded by a hefty 52 - 29 margin . This is the eigth straight victory for the Blazers , who now have the second best record in the Western Conference . LaMarcus Aldridge was an unstoppable force on Monday , as the Sixers ' young frontcourt had no answer for him . He went off for 33 points ( 13 - 20 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) and 11 rebounds , giving him his second straight double - double and fifth on the year . Fellow superstar Damian Lillard shot 6 - for - 11 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 16 points , while also grabbing five rebounds and handing out four assists . He 's now averaging 20 points and 7 assists on the year . Wes Matthews was the other major contributor on the offensive side of the ball , as he shot 6 - for - 16 from the field and 2 - for - 8 from beyond the arc to score 17 points in 32 minutes . The only other Blazer to reach double figures in scoring was Robin Lopez , who had 12 points and eight rebounds . The Sixers were led by Michael Carter-Williams , who scored a season - high 24 points , while also grabbing seven rebounds . It was his seventh game of the season after sitting out with injury , and he seems to be getting back in a rhythm . Fellow backcourt mate Tony Wroten also had a solid all - around game on Monday . He came one assist shy of his second double - double of the season and finished with 20 points and nine assists . The third Sixer who reached the 20 - point mark was starting center Henry Sims . Sims finished with 22 points , which was a nice surprise for the Sixers as he 's only averaging 9 points on the season . Coming off the bench , Nerlens Noel had 12 points and five rebounds . The Blazers ' next game will be on the road in Charlotte against the Hornets on Wednesday , while the Sixers will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday .
The Sacramento Kings defeated the Los Angeles Lakers,116-92 , at Golden 1 Center on Monday . The Kings ( 9 - 15 ) came away with a blowout win to snap a three - game losing streak , but it took its toll on the home team , as they lost Rudy Gay ( hip flexor ) and Ben McLemore ( quad ) during the game . Before the two injuries , the physical battle between DeMarcus Cousins and Julius Randle caused Lakers ( 10 - 17 ) head coach Luke Walton to get ejected after arguing a controversial no call on Cousins . Both players went to the ground , and it appeared that Cousins had some part in pulling Randle down with him near the top of the key , off the ball . Los Angeles got some life following the ejection and used it to finish the half with a nine - point lead . DeMarcus Cousins bounced back on his own to lead the third quarter Kings surge , where the big man had a major part in outscoring the Lakers 39 - 13 during that period . Los Angeles had no response following the big scoring run for Sacramento . The Lakers are now on a seven - game losing streak . Cousins finished with 31 points , 16 rebounds , five assists , two steals and three blocks to round out his monstrous performance . The Kings all - star center went 12 - of - 21 shooting , including 2 - of - 3 from behind the arc .

The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Boston Celtics , 105 - 99 , at Wells Fargo Center on Sunday afternoon . The Celtics ( 44 - 26 ) had come into Sunday just 2 games behind the top - seeded Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference , with a golden opportunity to make up further ground . They knew they 'd have a challenge on their hands , however , as the Sixers ( 26 - 43 ) had been playing much better basketball than their record indicated and they 'd also be missing team MVP Isaiah Thomas for a second straight contest with knee soreness . Accordingly , Philadelphia managed to play spoiler effectively , overcoming a 13 - point fourth - quarter deficit . Thomas ' absence certainly helped the Sixers ' cause , but they earned the upset victory by limiting Boston to 40 percent shooting from the field and 21 percent from three - point range , while also forcing 17 turnovers . Al Horford paced the Celtics with 27 points , a total he supplemented with eight boards , six assists , two blocks and one steal . Jae Crowder filled out the stat sheet with 15 points , seven rebounds , four assists and one steal . Terry Rozier was next with a bench - leading 14 - point , 10 - rebound double - double that also included two assists and one steal . Avery Bradley supplied 13 points , three rebounds , two assists and two steals . Kelly Olynyk was productive off the bench as well with 12 points , one rebound and one assist . Marcus Smart drew a second straight start in Thomas ' stead and chipped in eight points , eight assists , six rebounds and two steals . Dario Saric led the Sixers with 23 points , six rebounds , four assists and two steals . Robert Covington tallied 16 points , eight rebounds and two steals and drained the go - ahead three - pointer in the fourth period . Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot supplied 13 points , two boards and one assist . Jahlil Okafor exited early with knee soreness after 12 minutes , posting four points and one rebound before heading to the bench . A trio of nine - point efforts from Sergio Rodriguez , Gerald Henderson and Nik Stauskas paced the reserves . The Celtics return home to tangle with the Washington Wizards on Monday evening , while the Sixers head to Central Florida for a Monday night date with the Orlando Magic .
The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Detroit Pistons , 87 - 77 , at Spectrum Arena on Wednesday . The Hornets ( 13 - 9 ) have often counted on their standout guard combo of Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum this season to serve as the foundation of their offense , and their contributions came in particularly handy Wednesday against the Pistons ( 12 - 12 ) . Andre Drummond posted a 26 - point , 20 - rebound double - double for Detroit that also featured an assist and a pair of blocks , but the Hornets ' dynamic duo countered with a 25 - point tally from Walker and a 14 - point , 15 - rebound effort from Batum . Despite the trio of remarkable performances , it was largely a defensive - minded contest , with both teams shooting under 40 percent from the field , and with the Pistons posting a particularly unsightly 15 percent success rate from behind the arc . Tobias Harris was a distant second on Detroit with 14 points , seven rebounds , two assists and a block . Reggie Jackson continued to ramp up his minutes in his third game back from offseason knee problems , totaling 10 points , three rebounds , two assists and a block over 26 minutes . Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Marcus Morris had quiet nights on the scoreboard by their standards with a pair of seven - point contributions , but the latter did haul in 10 rebounds . Jon Leuer headlined a modest outing for the second unit with six points , six assists and four rebounds . Walker added four assists , three rebounds and two steals to his game - high scoring haul , while Batum also dished out three dimes . Marvin Williams was back in the starting lineup after missing six games with a knee injury and supplied 12 points , five rebounds and a steal . Cody Zeller posted nine points , six rebounds and a block , while Marco Belinelli led the reserves with 13 points , five rebounds , an assist and two steals in 28 minutes . The Pistons continue on the road and next visit with the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday evening , while the Hornets remain home to face off with the Orlando Magic on Friday night as well .
The host Dallas Mavericks ( 17 - 13 ) defeated the Chicago Bulls ( 16 - 12 ) by a score of 118 - 111 , on Saturday night . The game was a back - and - forth nail - biter , which featured 15 lead changes and was tied 108 - 108 with 2:54 left in the game . Dallas grinded out the last few minutes with some solid defense , including a big steal which led to a basket that put them up by four with 50 seconds left . The Bulls then gave up an unforced turnover on a five - second inbound violation that destroyed their chance of victory . Chicago came into this game after a solid win on Christmas day and while they are still missing two big pieces in Joakim Noah and Mike Dunleavy , being short - handed on this second night of a back - to - back could be part of the reason why they collapsed late in the fourth . Five players scored in double digits for the Bulls . The high - point man was Derrick Rose , who finished with 25 points ( 12 - 20 FG ) , five rebounds and four assists , in 36 minutes . Nikola Mirotic poured in 23 points on strong 6 - 10 shooting from the field ( 4 - 7 3PT , 7 - 11 FT ) , along with seven rebounds , three blocks , two steals and one assist , in 40 minutes . Pau Gasol finished with 18 points ( 7 - 10 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) , nine rebounds , three assists and three blocks , in 38 minutes . The Bulls starters were forced to play a lot of minutes in this one , which again could have affected their play late in the game . Chicago did however shoot a strong 53 percent from the field . Dallas also had six players score in double digits . J.J. Barea had a fantastic game filling in at starting PG for the injured Deron Williams . Barea finished with 26 points , while shooting a brilliant 7 - 8 from behind the arc , along with five assists , in 32 minutes . Chandler Parsons dropped in 20 points ( 8 - 15 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt ) , five rebounds , five assists and two steals , in 35 minutes off the bench . Zaza Pachulia tallied a solid double - double with 17 points and 12 rebounds , in 29 minutes . The Mavericks shot 48 percent from long range and hit 22 - 28 free throws . With this win Dallas is now 6 - 6 against the East . Next Dallas will host Milwaukee on Monday and look to go above .500 against the pesky East . The Bulls will have their hands full once again , as they host Toronto on Monday for what should be a great Eastern Conference battle .
The San Antonio Spurs ( 55 - 26 ) defeated the Phoenix Suns ( 39 - 42 ) 107 - 91 on Sunday at the AT & T Center in San Antonio . The Spurs continued their unbelievable stretch , winning their eleventh game in a row and propelling themselves into the second spot in the Western Conference standings . After many had criticized the defending champs for their slow start to the season , the Spurs have made them eat their words , as they now own a half game lead over the Clippers , Grizzlies and Rockets for that second projected playoff seed . The Spurs were the superior shooters in this game , going 51 percent from the field and 42 percent from the three - point line , while the Suns finished at 41 percent from the floor and just 25 percent from deep . It was the Spurs ' frontcourt duo of Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard that helped seal the victory Sunday . Duncan finished with 22 points ( 7 - 11 FG , 8 - 9 FT ) , 10 rebounds and two blocked shots , while playing just 26 minutes . It was a very efficient showing for the veteran , who 's posted two double - doubles in a row . During that two - game stretch , he 's combined for 51 points and 20 rebounds , so Duncan is doing a great job of building even more momentum for himself as they head into the playoffs . Leonard , on the other hand , went 6 - for - 12 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score 18 points , to go along with nine rebounds . He 's had a fantastic span of games throughout April , averaging 20 points over seven games . He 's also done it defensively though , posting three or more steals in four out of those seven games as well . The Spurs received some solid contributions off their bench . Cory Joseph had 13 points ( 5 - 7 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and four rebounds over 19 minutes , while Marco Belinelli posted 13 points ( 4 - 8 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) and four assists over 24 minutes . Eric Bledsoe and Gerald Green were the only two Suns ' players that really had any success against the Spurs ' defense .

Green , on the other hand , went 8 - for - 16 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score 23 points , while also adding four rebounds over 26 minutes . Over his last five games , he 's now averaging 19 points , as he 's been one of the few bright spots for the Suns . Markieff Morris and Archie Goodwin were the only other two players to reach double figures . Morris finished with 12 points ( 4 - 10 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and five rebounds , while Goodwin recorded 11 points ( 5 - 15 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) and four rebounds .

The San Antonio Spurs ( 47 - 9 ) held off the Phoenix Suns ( 14 - 42 ) for a 118 - 111 win on Sunday . This was a much closer matchup than anticipated , with the Suns hanging around all game long . The game was actually tied with six minutes left , but the Spurs went on a 70 run from there to ultimately decide the game . San Antonio 's three - point shooting was the key , as they went 10 - for - 16 from long distance in the victory . They also shot 52 percent from the field , while holding Phoenix to 46 percent on their end . San Antonio hasn’t been playing impressively lately , but they continue to win games . This is the second game in a row where they allowed a double - digit underdog to hang around and score over 110 points . With that in mind , both of those games came without All-Star Kawhi Leonard . In this game , Tony Parker led the team with 22 points with Patty Mills scoring 21 of his own off the bench . LaMarcus Aldridge also played well , as he tallied 19 points and 10 rebounds en route to a double - double . The Spurs next game will be against the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday . Phoenix came into this matchup as a 14 - point underdog and nearly pulled out a miraculous win . Alex Len got the start for the injured Tyson Chandler and played great , double - doubling in a 23 - point , 13 - rebound performance . The bench was what kept the Suns around though , as Jon Leuer , Mirza Teletovic and Archie Goodwin all scored at least 13 points while combing for 18 total rebounds . On deck for the Suns is a matchup with the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday in the second half of a back - to - back set .
The Denver Nuggets ( 22 - 32 ) defeated the Detroit Pistons ( 27 - 27 ) 103 - 92 on Wednesday night . A 14 - 2 run in the fourth quarter was the decisive moment for the Nuggets in their victory . Denver held Detroit to just 39 points in the second half and allowed them to shoot only seven free - throws in the game . The benches were a huge difference as well , with the Nuggets bench scoring 46 points to the Pistons 25 .

Danilo Gallinari and Emmanuel Mudiay gave the team some nice all - around performances , as they combined for 29 points , 10 rebounds , 10 assists and four steals in the win . Denver will be off until the 19th when they play the Sacramento Kings after the All-Star break . Detroit had to play this game without Reggie Jackson and it clearly hurt them late . Jackson is one of the leading scorers in the final five minutes of games and the Pistons were completely shut down for a long stretch in the fourth quarter . Marcus Morris scored a team - leading 19 points while also grabbing six rebounds in the defeat . Andre Drummond played a great defensive game , as he tallied 15 points , 17 rebounds , five blocks and three steals in the loss .

It 's been a rough stretch of three games over the last four days for Kawhi Leonard - - by his standards - - after he got off to a scorching hot start to the month of March . Following his 22 - point performance ( 20 of which came in the second half ) in Tuesday 's comeback victory over the Timberwolves , Leonard has now failed to score at least 25 points in each of his last three games after hitting that total in seven of his eight previous games . The All-Star also has n't been shooting the ball at an efficient rate as of late , with Tuesday 's 54 percent performance from the field being his best since last Wednesday when he hit 57 percent of his shots in a loss to Portland . In the two games in between , Leonard shot a combined 9 - of - 27 ( 30 percent ) from the field , which was easily his worst two - game shooting stretch of the season .
The Denver Nuggets ( 12 - 15 ) defeated the Indiana Pacers ( 8 - 19 ) 76 - 73 on Saturday . Denver is on a two - game win streak . Ty Lawson led the way with 15 points and 10 assists for a double - double . Danilo Gallinari got in on the fun off the bench , scoring a team - high 19 points in 28 minutes . Both teams struggled to put the ball in the basket . Denver shot just 37 percent from the field , but they gained an advantage by holding the Pacers to an even worse 31 percent shooting . Indiana has lost two straight and ten of their last 11 games . They had just three players score in double figures Saturday , with David West scoring a team - high 19 points to go along with ten rebounds and five assists . Starting center Roy Hibbert continues to struggle in his return from a sprained ankle . He got into foul trouble Saturday that limited him to zero points and five rebounds in 24 minutes . The Pacers will finish their road trip against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday .
The Knicks have been a different team this season and dominating wins like this show their improvement . Orlando had a one - point lead early in the first quarter , but that marked their only lead of the game . Three-point shooting really killed the Magic , as they went 5 - of - 27 , while the Knicks went 9 - of - 20 from long range . Serge Ibaka was Orlando 's best player , as he tallied 23 points and 10 rebounds en route to a double - double . Evan Fournier was n't far behind , as he accrued 21 points , five rebounds and four assists . Nikola Vucevic , Elfrid Payton and Jeff Green came off the bench to score 10 points a piece for Orlando . The Knicks bench outmatched that though , as they got 12 assists from Brandon Jennings and a monster 14 - point , 16 - rebound double - double from Kyle O'Quinn . Derrick Rose led the Knicks starters in scoring , as he dropped 19 points , five rebounds and three assists .
The Utah Jazz ( 26 - 36 ) defeated the Brooklyn Nets ( 25 - 36 ) 95 - 88 on Sunday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn . The Jazz continued their strong play of late , recording their second straight win and seventh of their last ten . Despite the loss , the Nets actually were the superior shooters in this one , going 50 percent from the field and 53 percent from the three - point line , while the Jazz finished at 47 percent from the floor and 46 percent from deep . What may have been the deciding factor were free throws though . The Jazz converted on 17 - of - 21 , while the Nets shot just 11 and converted on only four of those 11 attempts . As has been the case for the Jazz all season , both Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors did the bulk of the work offensively . Hayward finished with a team - high of 24 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 8 - 9 FT ) , while adding five rebounds and three steals as well . It was his second impressive performance in a row , as he 's combined for 49 points , 14 rebounds , five assists and four steals over his last two . He 's now averaging 20 points and 5 rebounds on the year . Favors , on the other hand , posted 22 points ( 8 - 16 FG , 6 - 8 FT ) , eight rebounds and four assists in 37 minutes . He 's also played very well of late , averaging 19 points and 7 rebounds over his last four games . Rookie Dante Exum had one of the better games of his career , notching double figures in points for just the seventh time this season and first since the end of January . He went 5 - for - 6 from the field and a perfect 4 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 14 points , while adding four assists as well . The only other Jazz player to reach double - digit points was Trey Burke , who came off the bench for 12 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt ) and four assists in 20 minutes . The Nets really struggled to score in this one , with just three players reaching double figures in points . One of those players was Brook Lopez , who took over the starting center spot for Mason Plumlee , as Plumlee was put back into a bench role . In 35 minutes , Lopez scored 19 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 3 - 5 FT ) , to go along with 10 rebounds and two blocked shots . It was his second double - double in a row , as he 's combined for 38 points and 23 rebounds over that span . He 's now averaging 16 points and 7 rebounds on the season . Along with Lopez , Thaddeus Young also moved into the starting lineup Sunday , pushing Alan Anderson to the bench . He matched a team - high with 19 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt ) , while also adding three rebounds and four steals in 32 minutes . With such a strong performance , he should continue to start for the forseeable future . Coming off the bench , Bojan Bogdanovic added 11 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 3 - 4 3Pt ) in 21 minutes . Both Joe Johnson and Deron Williams struggled in this one , scoring nine and six points respectively . The Jazz 's next game will be at home against the New York Knicks on Tuesday , while the Nets will be at home against the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday .
The San Antonio Spurs ( 5 - 2 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 1 - 7 ) 104 - 83 Monday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento . The game remained close through three quarters , as the return of DeMarcus Cousins , who was out with an Achilles injury , kept the Kings in the game . However , the Spurs dominated the fourth quarter , winning the period 34 - 19 and pulling away . Kawhi Leonard continues to lead the way for San Antonio to start the season , as he finished with a game - high 24 points on an efficient 10 - of - 13 shooting in 32 minutes .

The Atlanta Hawks defeated the San Antonio Spurs , 114 - 112 , in overtime at Phillips Arena on Sunday . Kawhi Leonard made his return for the Spurs ( 27 - 7 ) after a two - game absence due to a stomach virus , but the bigger story on the San Antonio side turned out to be LaMarcus Aldridge , who bounced back nicely from an eight - point performance against his former Trail Blazers teammates on Friday to score 27 points , along with 13 rebounds , two assists and three blocks . Meanwhile , on Atlanta 's end , it was Tim Hardaway , Jr. who posted 29 points off the bench . His 26 - foot three - point jumper with three seconds remaining in regulation knotted the game at 100 , and Leonard 's missed 14 - foot shot as time expired insured a fifth quarter . Hardaway drained two more three - pointers early and a key free throw late in the extra period , and Leonard missed a driving layup at the buzzer , helping the Hawks ( 18 - 16 ) escape with a hard - fought win . Tony Parker tallied 22 points , six assists and three rebounds behind Aldridge . Pau Gasol had a near double - double with 18 points , nine boards , two assists , a steal and a block .

Hayward also buried a trio of three pointers , in addition to finishing 12 - of - 13 from the free throw line .

With just under 13 seconds left in the game , DeMar DeRozan was able to hit a jump shot , putting the Raptors up by two . On the Wizards next posession , John Wall attempted to drive to the hoop , but got blocked by Kyle Lowry . The Wizards got the ball back after the block , and Wall had one more shot to win the game , but he missed a three - pointer at the buzzer , giving the Raptors the close two - point victory in front of their home crowd . While the Wizards ( 46 percent ) shot better than the Raptors from the field ( 41 percent ) , the Raptors took the advantage from the three - point line , going 42 percent from deep , while the Wizards went just 24 percent . Along with the go - ahead bucket that helped give the Raptors a victory , DeRozan also posted 23 points ( 6 - 18 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt , 10 - 10 FT ) , three rebounds and three steals in the victory . He 's on an impressive stretch of three games where he 's averaging 22 points , five rebounds and 3 steals per game .

Along with the block of Wall in the final seconds , Lowry also added 13 points ( 5 - 12 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt ) , four rebounds and six assists . His points totals were down , but with DeRozan and Williams playing so well , he did n't have to do as much offensively . Greivis Vasquez recorded 11 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 3 - 5 3PT ) in just 18 minutes as well . John Wall led the team for the Wizards , but just could n't come up clutch in the final moments . He finished with 21 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 6 - 8 FT ) , four rebounds and eight assists . He shot only 30 percent ( 3 - 10 FG ) from the field in Monday 's game against the Magic , so it was nice to see some improvement with his shot . Paul Pierce also played a factor , going 7 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 17 points . After combining for just eight points over his last two games , he was much more efficient with his time Wednesday .

It was his second straight night with 14 points , while the four steals matched a season - high .

The Toronto Raptors defeated the Miami Heat , 99 - 91 , on Wednesday night at the Air Canada Centre to take a 3 - 2 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals . The Raptors built a 28 - 18 cushion after one quarter that the Heat spent the majority of game trying to chip away at , but ultimately , Toronto kept pulling away just enough to ultimately secure the victory . The contest was a costly one for both teams health - wise , but particularly for a Miami squad that was already short - handed coming in . Luol Deng had to exit the game after 24 minutes due to a left wrist injury , completing the decimation of a Heat frontcourt that previously lost Chris Bosh ( clots ) and Hassan Whiteside ( knee ) . Meanwhile , DeMarre Carroll mirrored Deng 's misfortune , leaving with his own left wrist contusion after 26 minutes . DeMar DeRozan did n't exactly escape unscathed either , as he appeared to reaggravate the thumb injury that he originally suffered in Game 1 . However , the standout two - guard finished the game and did n't allow the ailment to slow him , as he scored a team - leading 34 points and added four rebounds , two assists and two steals . The performance featured a perfect 11 - for - 11 effort from the free - throw line , with several of the baskets coming in the game 's final minutes to help stave off a comeback by the visitors . Miami was led by Dwyane Wade , who scored 20 points , along with seven rebounds , four assists and a block . Goran Dragic , who appeared to come up limping after a change of possession late in the fourth quarter , was next with 13 points , five rebounds and a pair of dimes . Joe Johnson pitched in 11 points , eight rebounds and an assist . Josh Richardson paced the reserves with 13 points , three rebounds , an assist , a steal and a block over 22 minutes . Josh McRoberts and Udonis Haslem , who both stand to see an uptick in playing time if Deng is forced to miss a do - or - die Game 6 , tallied six points and three boards apiece off the bench . The former also added a steal . Kyle Lowry may have played second fiddle in terms of scoring to his talented backcourt mate , but drained several key buckets in the final two minutes to secure the win . He finished with 25 points , 10 rebounds , six assists , three steals and a block . Although he only managed to net nine of his 25 shot attempts , he did sink four of his nine tries from beyond the arc , including a 25 - footer with 52 seconds remaining . Bismack Biyombo acquitted himself well in his second start in Jonas Valanciunas ' ( ankle ) stead , tallying 10 points , six rebounds , two steals and four blocks . He scored two for the other team as well , as he was called for goal tending late in the fourth quarter . Corey Joseph paced the second unit with nine points , five assists , a rebound and two steals . The two teams reconvene down in South Florida for a pivotal Game 6 on Friday night at American Airlines Arena , with the respective statuses of Deng and Carroll currently up in the air .
The Washington Wizards ( 28 - 30 ) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 41 - 17 ) 113 - 99 on Sunday . LeBron James was given an off day for only the second time this season and unfortunately for the Cavs , the results of his absence were somewhat predictable . The final margin of victory for the Wizards belied their game - long dominance of Cleveland , who was already staring at a 96 - 70 deficit heading into the final period . Washington 's first unit unsurprisingly bested Cleveland 's starting five in all major categories , and only Kyrie Irving appeared determined to try and keep the game respectable for the short - handed visitors . The victory was a crucial one for a Wizards squad that needs every win it can get down the stretch , and the comfortable second - half lead allowed their front - line players some much needed rest . All five members of the first unit were able to play under 30 minutes for the Wizards , a welcome luxury in the latter stages of what has been a tough season for them to date . Irving 's 28 points spearheaded Cleveland 's attack on the afternoon , and the game - high scoring total was supplemented by six assists and a rebound . Kevin Love was a distant second with 12 points , five rebounds and an assist in just 24 minutes of play . Veteran Richard Jefferson drew the start in James ' place , and contributed 10 points , five boards and an assist . Tristan Thompson ( two points , two rebounds , two assists ) and J.R.

The Los Angeles Clippers ( 10 ) defeated the Houston Rockets ( 0 - 1 ) 117 - 101 in Game 1 of the Western Conference Semifinals on Monday . Blake Griffin not only dropped a triple - double , but also saw some time at point guard on offense in the fourth quarter for the Clippers , who were without their leader Chris Paul . He hurt his hamstring in the miraculous Game 7 of Los Angeles ' win over the San Antonio Spurs . On Monday they turned their attention to a different Texas team but wound up with the same result . Griffin 's triple - double marks his third of the postseason , no other player has recorded one triple - double so far . DeAndre Jordan did a bang up job on the inside . He finished with 10 points , 13 rebounds , five assists , four blocks , two steals and just two late fouls when the game was already seemingly out of hand for the Rockets . Austin Rivers , who started in place on Paul , finished with 17 points and four steals in 28 minutes . Jamal Crawford quietly had a good game with 21 points , five boards , four assists and two steals . However , like many players in this game , was bit by the turnover bug . Crawford had six of his teams 21 turnovers . The Rockets had a 13 - point in the first lead but could n't hold on , even without Paul in the opposing lineup . Houston 's lead shrank to just four points at halftime . They kept it close for a little while but Los Angeles was able to skip away slowly and won the game going away . With plenty of hack - a - whoever to go around in this one , the Clippers were able to win both the third and fourth quarters by 10 points each , and now hold a 10 lead in the series to go along with homecourt advantage . James Harden learned Monday that Stephen Curry won the MVP . He had a solid game with 20 points , 12 assists , five rebounds and four steals . Unfortunately for the Rockets , he also had nine costly turnovers .
The Golden State Warriors ( 41 - 4 ) defeated the San Antonio Spurs ( 38 - 7 ) 120 - 90 at Oracle Arena on Monday . The most anticipated matchup of the season resulted in a surprising 30 - point rout in favor of the Warriors . The first of four regular season matchups between the NBA’s two best teams started off shaky for San Antonio , as they converted eight turnovers in the first quarter , and never truly recovered over the next three periods . The turnovers started at the expense of Tony Parker , the 15 year veteran who uncharacteristically made bad passes , was out played by Stephen Curry on the defensive end . Kawhi Leonard was eventually switched to guard the reigning MVP , but was as unsuccessful as Parker in trying to slow down Curry . Leonard led the Spurs in scoring and finished with 16 points on 4 - of - 6 shooting , to go along with five rebounds and two assists . David West started in place of Tim Duncan ( knee ) , and also finished in double - figures with 12 points . LaMarcus Aldridge was unable to get comfortable in the post , Boris Diaw faced difficulty getting space and Manu Ginobili was equally ineffective from behind the arc and on the drive . The loss snapped a 13 game winning streak for San Antonio . The Spurs will look to bounce back when they host the Houston Rockets ( 25 - 22 ) on Wednesday . The Warriors did not disappoint in their own arena , and were more impressive on the defensive end of the floor as compared to their high powered offense . While Golden State dropped 120 points , they harassed the Spurs and forced 26 turnovers which led to an early first half lead , in which they did not let go of the rest of the game . The quickness of the Warriors offense caused constant mismatches , especially in the paint after the drive , where Shaun Livingston was the first to wreck havoc in transition . Livingston’s 13 points were mostly seen in the second quarter . Stephen Curry was far from quiet and started to heat up where Livingston left off , as he scored 37 points on 12 - of - 20 shooting , including six three - pointers in 28 minutes . Draymond Green commanded the offense during many of the Warriors possessions , as a result , he rounded out the box score with 11 points , nine rebounds and six assists . Six Warriors players finished in double figures with no one player going for more than 28 minutes , as the lead in the fourth quarter was comfortable enough to run the reserves . The win marks the fourth straight for Golden State . The Warriors will host the Dallas Mavericks ( 25 - 21 ) , one of the only teams to beat them this season , on Wednesday .
Hassan Whiteside spearheaded Miami to their 10th straight win with a monstrous 30 - point , 20 - rebound double - double , and the Heat bench totaled 50 points . They also posted outstanding 59 and 55 percent success rates from the field and three - point range , respectively , allowing them to overcome 20 turnovers . Dion Waiters followed Whiteside with 21 points . Goran Dragic was next with 16 points , and Tyler Johnson matched Dragic 's point total to lead the bench . Wayne Ellington and James Johnson were productive as reserves as well , tallying 11 and 10 points , respectively . The Sixers were led by Ersan Ilyasova , who posted 21 points . Gerald Henderson was next with 12 points , while Richaun Holmes followed with a near double - double consisting of 12 points and nine rebounds . T.J. McConnell generated 11 points , while Sean Rodriguez contributed 10 points as a reserve .
There were 12 ties and 13 lead changes , as this game came down to the final seconds . In fact , no team led by more than 10 points in the tightly contested game . Portland took much better care of the ball than Chicago , as they recorded 25 assists to just nine turnovers . The Bulls on the other hand , committed 15 turnovers , while assisting on just 16 buckets . Portland were able to prevail , despite being outrebounded , 50 - 38 . Damian Lillard and C.J . McCollum led the Blazers once again , as they combined for 54 points and 12 assists . The Bulls backcourt of Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade did everything they could to match that , as they combined for 60 points , 11 rebounds and nine assists . The other six starters combined for just 46 points , as those four superstars were leaned on heavily in this matchup . Nikola Mirotic and Allen Crabbe were nice sparks off the bench , as Crabbe dropped 17 for the Blazers and Mirotic scored 18 for the Bulls .
In a down - to - the - wire game , the Orlando Magic ( 10 - 8 ) were able to pull out a win against the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 8 - 10 ) , finishing up 96 - 93 . Orlando is now in the Eastern Conference playoff picture , and the win against the Timberwolves marks the team 's fourth straight . Center Nikola Vucevic was a difference - maker for the Magic , recording a team - high 37 minutes and an 18 - point , 12 - rebound double - double . Orlando seemed to ride Vucevic 's hot hand all night , as he took a game - high 19 shots . The game also marked the continuation of shooting guard Victor Oladipo 's new role as a sixth man , a change that seems to have benefited Orlando 's rotations . Oladipo followed up a 19 - point outing off the bench against Boston with 13 points tonight to go with four rebounds , four assists , and three steals . All in all , the Magic appear to be clicking , as they now have a substantial win streak and sit two games above .500 . For the Timberwolves , meanwhile , the close loss saw some unorthodox rotations from coach Sam Mitchell . As rookie center Karl-Anthony Towns struggled from the field ( 2 - for - 11 ) , backup big man Gorgui Dieng stepped in to play a season - high 29 minutes . Dieng looked solid defensively , recording three blocks and a steal while also playing efficient offense , tallying 11 points on 4 - of - 6 shooting . The Louisville alum has seen a steady uptick in minutes recently , and with his elevated play , this could be a continuing trend in the crowded Minnesota frontcourt . With four straight wins under their belt , the Magic will hope to extend the streak even further as they face the Jazz on Thursday . Meanwhile , the Timberwolves will look to bounce back on Saturday as they prepare to square off against Portland .
The Atlanta Hawks ( 22 - 8 ) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks ( 15 - 16 ) 90 - 85 on Saturday . Playing on the second night of a home - and - home back - to - back between these two teams , the Hawks came into Saturday 's game looking for revenge after they took a beating at the hands of the Bucks 107 - 77 on Friday , and they got their revenge . Atlanta jumped out to a 21 - 10 lead after the first quarter . They gave up most of their lead in the second quarter but had enough to hang on for the win . Jeff Teague paced the team with a game - high 25 points in 37 minutes , indicating that he is probably over his hamstring injury . The Hawks shot a putrid 37 percent from the field but were able to secure the win by holding the Bucks to an unremarkable 39 percent shooting from the field and by getting 32 easy points on 19 turnovers by the Bucks . Milwaukee was playing without Ersan Ilyasova ( concussion ) and Larry Sanders ( illness ) , leaving them inadequately supplied to deal with the strength and skill of Al Horford and Paul Millsap . Khris Middleton found success off the bench , putting up a team - high 21 points in 37 minutes . The Bucks will continue their road trip against the Charlotte Hornets on Monday .
The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Detroit Pistons , 109 - 101 , at Barclays Center on Wednesday . The Pistons came in to Wednesday riding a 3 - 1 record , while the Nets sported a 1 - 3 mark that seemed indicative of their lack of offensive firepower . However , a pair of standout efforts from Brook Lopez on the first unit and Sean Kilpatrick off the bench led Brooklyn ( 2 - 3 ) to the upset victory and stellar 54 and 48 percent success rates from the field and three - point range , respectively . The Nets were also superior around the basket , as they outrebounded the visitors by a 45 - 38 margin , with 40 of those boards on the defensive end . They also outscored Detroit ( 3 - 2 ) 50 - 34 in the paint , while holding standout big man Andre Drummond to a season - low six points and six rebounds . The reliable duo of Marcus Morris and Tobias Harris co - led the Pistons with a pair of 23 - point efforts , with the former adding four rebounds , two assists and three steals and the latter also supplying four boards , an assist and a steal . Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was the only other member of the starting five with double - digit scoring , totaling 15 points and also registering seven rebounds , two assists and four steals . Jon Leuer continued his strong work off the bench in the early going this season , compiling 11 points , seven rebounds and two blocks , while fellow veteran Beno Udrih managed 10 points , four assists , a rebound and a steal . Lopez exploded for a 34 - point , 11 - rebound double - double to lead the way for the Nets , and added an assist , a steal and a block . The versatile big man went 12 - of - 21 from the field and also impressively drained half of his eight long - range tries . Bojan Bogdanovic collected 11 points , four rebounds and a pair of assists , while Jeremy Lin supplied 10 points , four assists and a pair of boards . Kilpatrick led the bench with a season - high 24 points and 10 rebounds while also dishing out three assists and recording two steals .

The Oklahoma City Thunder ( 27 - 25 ) beat the Denver Nuggets ( 19 - 33 ) , 124 - 114 , on Monday . Kevin Durant had his second - best scoring performance of the season with 40 points on 13 - of - 19 from the field . Russell Westbrook added 26 points with five rebounds and nine assists . Starting in place of Steven Adams , who recently had surgery on his fractured hand , Kendrick Perkins played 20 minutes , recording four points and two rebounds . Mitch McGary followed up his 19 - point , 10 - rebound performance from Sunday with 17 points and 10 rebounds . He did n't play more than 25 minutes in either game but could be a force going forward with Perkins underproducing and Adams out for a few weeks . The Nuggets are slipping fast . They are 1 - 13 since winning five straight in early January . Kenneth Faried put up 22 points and 10 rebounds , but it was n't nearly enough to overcome Durant 's hot shooting night . Jusuf Nurkic had 16 points , 14 rebounds and two steals . Denver was without JaVale McGee ( illness ) and Jameer Nelson ( Achilles ) , who were both questionable going into Monday 's game . The Nuggets are now nine - and - a - half games back from the final playoff spot in the Western Conference . The Thunder will take on the Grizzlies in Memphis on Wednesday , while the Nuggets will travel to Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Tuesday .
The Orlando Magic ( 7 - 8 ) defeated the New York Knicks ( 8 - 8 ) 100 - 91 on Wednesday . The Magic and Knicks played a very strange game on Wednesday , as both teams shot terribly , but did n't make many mistakes . In fact , Both teams shot below 40 percent from the field and the two teams combined for just 18 turnovers . Defense was clearly the focus for both teams , as the Knicks failed to record a fast - break point all game long . There were very little differences in the stat sheet and it simply came down to the fact that the Magic 's bench signicantly outplayed the Knicks bench . Orlando got 43 bench points to the Knicks 12 and that proved to be the difference . The Knicks came into this game as one of the hottest teams in the league , but struggled offensively in this matchup . This Scott Skiles defense stifled the Knicks , despite the fact that Carmelo Anthony and Jose Calderon scored season - highs in points . Anthony had his best game of the season statistically speaking , as he tallied 28 points and 13 rebounds in the loss . Calderon also had his best game in years , as he totaled 25 points , four assists and three rebounds in the defeat . It was the `` others '' who killed this team though , as no other player scored more than 10 points in the loss . It 's clear that this team plays better when Anthony takes less shots and that was the fact yet again on Wednesday . The Knicks will play the Miami Heat on Friday in their next scheduled game . The Magic made a strange move by relegating Victor Oladipo to the bench , but that proved to work wonders here . It 's unclear if it lit a fire under him or that he just played better in the second unit , but Oladipo had one of his best games of the season in that role . Oladipo scored a team - high 24 points off the bench and did that damage in just 26 minutes of action . Tobias Harris , Nikola Vucevic and Elfrid Payton all recorded double - doubles as well , and this was one of the best all - around team efforts the Magic have had all season . Orlando will look to play like this again when they take on the struggling Milwaukee Bucks on Friday .
The Clippers ( 12 - 5 ) extended their winning streak to five games Monday night , knocking off the Timberwolves 127 - 101 at the Staples Center . It was the second loss in as many nights for the Timberwolves , who fell to Portland 107 - 93 on Sunday .

The Los Angeles Clippers ( 21 - 13 ) held on for a road victory Thursday over the New Orleans Pelicans ( 10 - 22 ) at the Smoothie King Center , 95 - 89 . Despite one of Chris Paul’s worst shooting games as a professional — 3 - 18 , including 0 - 4 from three - point land — the Clippers held on and extended their winning streak to five games . After trailing for most of the first half , the Clippers took a 50 - 48 lead late in the second quarter and trailed only for 17 seconds in the second half as they managed to stave off a late but futile New Orleans run . J.J. Redick’s hot shooting night , including 9 - 15 from the field and 4 - 7 from three - point land , gave him 26 points to lead all scorers . Paul still scored nine points , grabbed five rebounds and dished out 12 assists despite his awful shooting night . DeAndre Jordan was a monster on the glass , as he grabbed 20 rebounds — including eight on the offensive end — and scored 11 points as he owned the paint in Blake Griffin’s absence . The Pelicans had six players finish in double figures , but Ryan Anderson was the only one to find his groove , as he led the club with 17 points on an efficient 7 - 11 shooting . Anthony Davis and Tyreke Evens scored 14 points each and Norris Cole scored 15 , but none managed to shoot 50 percent from the floor . The Pelicans shot 44 percent as a team and needed to be more accurate to overcome their rebounding disadvantage . The Clippers match up next with Philadelphia at home on Saturday . The Pelicans travel to Dallas for a Saturday date with the Mavericks .
The Orlando Magic ( 26 - 32 ) took care of the Philadelphia 76ers ( 8 - 51 ) in a 130 - 116 win on Sunday . Orlando came into this game as a rare double - digit favorite and didn’t disappoint . They really took control in the first half , as the Magic led 77 - 51 at the half . The shooting was stellar for Orlando , as they shot 57 percent from the field , 88 percent from the free - throw line and 63 percent from three - point range . The Magic starters actually combined for over 100 points for the first time all season . Not much is going right for the Sixers right now , as this marks their eighth - straight loss . Jahlil Okafor had yet another good game though , as he scored 26 points in the loss . Ish Smith also had a nice game , as he tallied 17 points , five rebounds and seven assists .

The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the visiting New York Knicks , 117 - 88 , at Quicken Loans Arena on Tuesday . The new - look Knicks ( 0 - 1 ) , who added Joakim Noah , Derrick Rose and Courtney Lee in a makeover of their starting five this offseason , had their moments at various points until the middle of the third quarter , at which point LeBron James , Kyrie Irving and rest of the defending NBA champions started to exert their dominance . New York 's comeback efforts were ultimately undermined by a collectively poor shooting night , vulnerability down in the paint despite the presence of Noah and standout second - year forward Kristaps Porzingis , and carelessness with the ball . New York managed just 37 percent shooting from the field , was out - rebounded on the defensive glass by a 40 - 29 margin , was outscored 52 - 28 in the paint , and allowed 21 points to the Cavs off 18 turnovers , all pivotal factors in a 29 - point defeat . New York was led by Carmelo Anthony , who played only 30 minutes in the blowout but managed 19 points , five rebounds , three assists and a steal . Rose put together a 17 - point effort in his Knicks debut after missing most of the preseason , but could only supplement the scoring with three rebounds , an assist and a block . Porzingis was solid with 16 points , seven rebounds , a steal and a pair of rejections , with more than half his scoring coming on three made three - pointers on five attempts . However , Noah and Lee were shut out on the scoreboard altogether , with the former making up somewhat for his lack of points with six boards , three assists and a steal in a modest 20 minutes . The decisive second - half lead the Cavs ( 10 ) eventually built up allowed their two biggest superstars to finish the last several minutes on the bench . Irving , often matched up against a rusty Derrick Rose , paced the Cavs with 29 points , four assists , two rebounds and two steals . James posted a triple - double , totaling 19 points , 14 assists , 11 rebounds and a block in just 32 minutes . Kevin Love contributed a double - double with 23 points , 12 boards , a pair of assists and a trio of steals . The recently re - signed J.R. Smith supplied eight points on 3 - for - 13 shooting against his former Knicks teammates . The Knicks head back to New York for their home opener against the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday night .

Rozier led the second unit with 15 points , including a three - pointer with 10 seconds left in regulation to tie matters up at 113 . Kelly Olynyk was productive as a reserve with 10 points .

Five players hit double digits in the scoring column for the visitors , and they shot 51 percent from the field overall .

Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard scored 11 of his 26 points in the third quarter . With 6:52 remaining in the period , Lillard knocked down one of his five three - pointers of the game to give Portland a 74 - 71 lead , a lead they would not relinquish .

George Hill scored 18 points and Ian Mahinmi notched a double - double with 10 points and 11 rebounds , but Pacers superstar Paul George was quiet , scoring 11 on a poor 4 - 17 shooting night . Despite shooting 43 percent from three , the Pacers shot just 43 percent from the floor overall . Indiana will look to rebound Saturday night against the Jazz in Utah . Portland 's next game comes on the road at Minnesota on Saturday .
The Memphis Grizzlies ( 5 - 6 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 5 - 5 ) 114 - 106 on Sunday . Second-year Timberwolves point guard Zach LaVine had several breakout performances during his rookie campaign after starter Ricky Rubio went down for the season . Early in the 2015 - 16 campaign LaVine has once again benefited from Rubio 's injury troubles , and only foul trouble hindered him Sunday from potentially posting his best day as pro . LaVine tallied an incredible 25 points in just 17 minutes of court time , shooting 8 - for - 15 from the field , including 4 - for - 7 from three - point range . The scoring was LaVine 's second highest total of the season , and would have shattered his high - water mark of 26 points had his time on the court not been curtailed . Another pair of dynamic young Timberwolves , Andrew Wiggins and 2015 first overall pick Karl-Anthony Towns , stepped up offensively in their own right to lead Minnesota . Wiggins amassed 21 points , while Towns ( 14 points , nine boards ) came within a rebound short of a double - double for the second straight game . The Timberwolves also enjoyed an extremely balanced effort from their bench , with four players ( Shabazz Muhammad , Andre Miller , Nemanja Bjelica , and Gorgui Dieng ) all pitching with eight - point efforts . The Timberwolves fell to 5 - 5 and reside in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They now head to Miami for a Tuesday tilt versus the Heat . The Grizzlies received a much - needed offensive boost from a somewhat unlikely source Sunday , as Jeff Green reentered the starting lineup with rousing success . Green poured in 21 points over a season - high 35 minutes on impressive 7 - of - 12 shooting . Meanwhile , Mike Conley continued to claw back from the low point of his season , a four - point , 1 - of - 12 shooting performance last Wednesday versus the Warriors . Conley tallied his first 20 - point effort since Nov. 7 , and chipped in seven assists and two steals . Frontcourt mates Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph had strong games of their own , with Gasol holding his own against the rookie sensation Towns to the tune of 16 points , seven rebounds , four assists , and a pair of blocks . Even new acquisition Mario Chalmers got into the act , pitching in 16 points off the bench over 18 minutes for his best game yet in a Grizzlies uniform . JaMychal Green also represented the Memphis reserves well , with a 12 - point outing . Memphis improved to 5 - 6 and resides in third place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head home for a date with the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday .
The Oklahoma City Thunder ( 44 - 37 ) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers ( 51 - 30 ) 101 - 90 on Monday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City . The Thunder were able to keep their playoff hopes alive with the win over the Blazers . The New Orleans Pelicans also came out with a win on Monday , so both the Thunder and Pelicans remain tied for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the West . The Pelicans own the tiebreaker though , so in order for the Thunder to get into the playoffs , they 'll need a win of their own , as well as a Pelican 's loss on Wednesday in the finale . The Trail Blazers , on the other hand , have locked up the fourth seed in the West . It 's still up in the air who they 'll end up having to play , but it could be either the San Antonio Spurs , Houston Rockets , Memphis Grizzlies or Los Angeles Clippers . Despite finishing with worse shooting percentages than the Blazers , the Thunder came out with a huge advantage on the boards , out - rebounding them 58 - 35 . It was the duo of Enes Kanter and Russell Westbrook who helped keep the Thunder in playoff contention . Westbrook went 13 - for - 27 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 36 points , to go along with 11 rebounds and seven assists . He 's been absolutely phenomenal throughout the whole second half of this season and he continues to put all the pressure on his own shoulders here in the final stretch , as he 's averaging a ridiculous 39 points , 7 rebounds and 7 assists over his last three games . Kanter , on the other hand , finished with 27 points ( 13 - 20 FG , 1 - 2 FT ) and 13 rebounds over 36 minutes . Kanter has scored over 20 points in five of his last seven games , a seven - game stretch where he 's averaging 21 points . Dion waiters ( 4 - 21 FG , 0 - 5 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) and Anthony Morrow ( 4 - 10 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) were the only other two players in double figures with 13 and 11 points respectively . Already heavily hit by the injury bug , this was another damaging game for the Blazers , as both Nicolas Batum and C.J . McCollum had to leave the game with injuries . McCollum went down with a nasty looking ankle injury , while Batum 's leg appeared to buckle as he went down with a knee injury . It 's an awful amount of bad luck for this Trail Blazers ' team , who could now go into the playoffs very shorthanded . With Aldridge also sitting this game out due to a foot injury , it was Meyers Leonard who led this team while in the starting lineup . Leonard posted a season - high of 24 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 5 - 9 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) , while also adding four rebounds and a blocked shot over 32 minutes . He 'll go into the season finale averaging 6 points and 5 rebounds in his second season as a pro . Damian Lillard did n't have his best showing of the season , posting just 10 points ( 3 - 9 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and six assists in the loss . After going off for 28 points in Saturday 's game against the Jazz , it was a disappointing performance for Lillard , who will need to play much better in the playoffs if the Blazers want any shot at making it past the first round . Joel Freeland added 16 points ( 8 - 13 FG ) and five rebounds off the bench , while Chris Kaman chipped in with 14 points ( 7 - 9 FG ) and four rebounds . The Thunder 's final game will be on the road against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday , while the Trail Blazers will travel to Dallas to play the Mavericks on Wednesday .
This game was tight throughout , as there were eight ties and 16 lead changes in total . The key to victory for Houston was the rebounding , as they won that differential , 52 - 38 .

The Denver Nuggets defeated the host Orlando Magic , 121 - 113 , at Amway Center on Saturday . In a game between two struggling teams , Orlando could n't quite keep up in their fourth game in five nights . That was clearly evident late , as the Nuggets ended the game on a 17 - 5 run to pull off the comeback . While the defense struggled all night , Denver held Orlando to just 18 points in the fourth quarter , while scoring 29 points on their end . The Nuggets offense was on point , as they shot 57 percent from the field and recorded 25 assists in the victory . Rebounding was key as well , with Denver winning that battle , 44 - 31 . Denver ( 9 - 15 ) rode one of their best offensive performances here to an impressive road win . While no player on the Nuggets had more than 21 points , they had six players score at least 14 . Danilo Gallinari led the team in scoring , tallying 21 points , six rebounds and three assists . Jusuf Nurkic scored 17 points and grabbed eight boards on 8 - of - 11 shooting in just 20 minutes of action . Kenneth Faried was huge off the bench , dropping 19 points and 10 rebounds on 9 - of - 10 from the field . Nikola Jokic and Juancho Hernangomez each scored 14 a piece off the bench . On deck for the Nuggets is a road matchup against the Dallas Mavericks on Monday . . Orlando ( 10 - 15 ) had to play this game without Nikola Vucevic and it clearly hurt their defense . Evan Fournier did all he could against his former team , as he led the Magic with 24 points , four rebounds and six assists . Serge Ibaka was n't far behind , accumulating 22 points , four rebounds and four blocks in the defeat . Jeff Green was questionable coming in to this game with an ankle injury , but provided 17 points off the bench . Orlando 's next game is on Tuesday in a road matchup against the Atlanta Hawks .
The host Orlando Magic defeated the Dallas Mavericks , 97 - 87 , at Amway Center on Saturday . In a battle between two inept offenses , the Magic were able to prevail with a much - needed victory . They took care of business late , as the Magic outscored the Mavericks 31 - 18 in the fourth quarter . Defense was key for Orlando , as they held Dallas to 34 percent shooting from the field and dominated the rebounding , 50 - 34 . The Magic not only controlled the paint through rebounding , as they outscored Dallas 32 - 16 in the paint as well . No team led by more than nine points , as this was tightly - contested throughout . Dallas ( 2 - 10 ) is in a historically bad stretch offensively right now and a 34 percent night just adds to those struggles . Newly-acquired , Jonathan Gibson , was the Mavericks best player , as he tallied 26 points , six rebounds and three assists off the bench . Wesley Matthews and Seth Curry led the starters in scoring , as they scored 13 apiece . Harrison Barnes went just 3 - of - 13 from the field , en route to an 11 - point night . The offensive struggles are likely to continue , as they travel to San Antonio on Monday to face the Spurs for their next game . Orlando ( 6 - 7 ) has been just as bad on offense as Dallas , but they were able to win here thanks to some elite defense . D.J . Augustin led the team in scoring , totaling 18 points and six assists off the bench . Serge Ibaka was second in scoring , tallying 15 points , nine rebounds and three blocks in the win . Nikola Vucevic amassed 12 points and 12 rebounds , despite going 5 - of - 16 from the field . Bismack Biyombo recorded a double - double off the bench , accruing 13 points , 10 rebounds and three blocks in the win . Orlando will look to keep rolling , as they travel to Milwaukee on Monday to face the Bucks .
Kevin Durant 's 29 - point first half is easily his best performance of the season , but it 's even better when you consider he single - handedly outscored the Thunder in the second quarter . The 39 points was a season - high and the seven made threes tied a career - high . While Draymond Green and Zaza Pachulia failed to reach double figures in scoring , their combined 20 rebounds , three steals and seven blocks played a huge factor on the other end of the floor . Despite leading the team with 21 points , Victor Oladipo provided just three rebounds , no assists and no steals or blocks in the blowout loss . That led to his - 25 plus - minus , which was one of the worst for the game . Enes Kanter talked a lot to Durant during the loss , but did almost all of it from the bench . In fact , he failed to score or rebound and played just three minutes in the defeat . Things should get better for the Thunder though , as they start a five - game homestand on Saturday and play three teams in that stretch expected to finish below .500 . The Warriors also have a nice five - game stretch approaching , as their next five games come against teams who failed to miss the playoffs last season .
James Harden has been seen as a legitimate MVP candidate in this young NBA season with his ability to stuff the stat sheet with points , assists and rebounds . He has , however , also managed to stuff it with turnovers as of late , especially when his assist number is high . In his last three games with at least 15 assists - - one of which happened in Wednesday night 's loss - - Harden has also posted at least eight turnovers . The 12 turnovers he had Wednesday was his season high and the first time he reached double - digit turnovers this season . For the Raptors , their MVP candidate DeMar DeRozan had another strong , 24 - point performance , but did n't come as easy as the box score may indicate . An astonishing 21 of of his 24 points came in the third quarter Wednesday night , as he managed to score 11 straight points for Toronto at one point in the period . He 's managed to keep his scoring average above 30 points , now at 31 points per game after Wednesday 's performance .

The aptly - named Greek Freak led the Bucks with 27 points , 13 rebounds , four assists , a steal and three blocks . Greg Monroe posted a near double - double off the bench with 18 points and nine boards .

Joakim Noah mustered a modest eight points but hauled in 16 boards . Mindaugas Kuzminskas paced the second unit with 15 points .
The San Antonio Spurs ( 14 - 5 ) edged the Memphis Grizzlies ( 15 - 4 ) 107 - 101 at FedEx Forum on Friday . Coming off an overtime loss to the Nets on Wednesday , San Antonio jumped out of the blocks and were never headed after Tony Parker got the first bucket of the night . Parker scored 14 points before leaving the game due to a hamstring strain , of which the severity is unknown at this point . Tim Duncan accumulated the fourth triple - double of his illustrious career , scoring 14 points with 10 rebounds and 10 assists in 36 minutes . Duncan also added two blocks to his impressive stat line . Danny Green 's hot streak continued , pouring in 16 points , including three three - pointers , bringing his recent tally to 17 made three - pointers in his last five games . The Spurs face off against the Timberwolves back home in San Antonio on Saturday .

They will try to right the ship Sunday against the visiting Miami Heat .
The Chicago Bulls ( 7 - 2 ) took down the Toronto Raptors ( 7 - 2 ) 100 - 93 on the road at the Air Canada Centre on Thursdsay night . The Bulls look to be the part of a serious contender to this point , and beating a strong team like the Raptors on the road just proves that . Chicago was led by an impressive team effort , and Pau Gasol posted yet another double - double with 27 points ( 12 - 19 FG , 3 - 4 FT ) , 11 rebounds , three blocks , two assists and one steal . Jimmy Butler also had a huge game , playing a total of 40 minutes and producing in a big way , scoring 21 points ( 7 - 10 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 6 - 8 FT ) with nine rebounds , six assists and one block . The Bulls will now head back home and take on the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night . For the Raptors , they nearly got a triple - double from Kyle Lowry . He had 20 points ( 8 - 19 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt , 1 - 3 FT ) , eight rebounds and eight assists , but it just was n't enough in the end . James Johnson also filled up the box score off the bench , scoring 16 points ( 7 - 9 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) to go with five rebounds , four steals , four blocks and one assist in just 24 minutes . The Raptors get a night off before taking on the Utah Jazz on their home floor on Saturday night .
The Washington Wizards ( 40 - 28 ) defeated the Utah Jazz ( 30 - 37 ) 88 - 84 on Wednesday in Salt Lake City . Following what was a tough stretch after the All-Star break , the Wizards are rolling and winners of five games in a row and seven of their last nine . John Wall led the way for Washington in this one , recording 24 points on 9 - of - 13 shooting , nine rebounds and six assists in 37 minutes .

Paul Pierce was the only other Wizard to score in double figures , finishing with 18 points on 6 - of - 10 shooting ( 4 - 5 3Pt ) in 28 minutes . The win pushes Washington to just a half game behind the Bulls for fourth place in the Eastern Conference standings , while also giving them a six - game lead over Milwaukee for fifth place . The loss for the Jazz ended a six - game winning streak , but Utah has still won nine of its last 11 games . Gordon Hayward has been great in that stretch for them , and he played well once again Wednesday night , scoring a game - high 26 points on 9 - of - 19 shooting , to go along with four rebounds and four assists in 35 minutes . Derrick Favors was the only other Jazz starter to score in double figures , finishing with 16 points on 8 - of - 18 shooting and nine rebounds . Trey Burke made a strong contribution off the bench , recording 14 points on 5 - of - 8 shooting and six assists in 28 minutes . Rudy Gobert finished with nine points and 14 rebounds , extending his streak of games with double - digit rebounds to 10 . Dante Exum was brutal in the start at point guard , as he shot 0 - for - 6 from the field and finished with zero points and zero assists in 20 minutes . Up next , the Wizards will head to Los Angeles Friday to take on the Clippers , while the Jazz will also head to Los Angeles and go up against the Lakers on Thursday .
The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 20 ) took a 20 lead in their opening round series with the Boston Celtics ( 0 - 2 ) on Tuesday with a 99 - 91 victory at the Quicken Loans Arena . Unlike in Game 1 where Boston could n't hang with Cleveland for all 48 minutes , the Celtics hung close with the Cavaliers for the entirety of Tuesday 's Game 2 . The Celtics had a chance to cut the Cavaliers ' lead to four with just under two minutes remaining , but Tyler Zeller 's jumper was blocked by LeBron James . Cleveland proceeded to run the clock down thanks to some timely offensive rebounding from Tristan Thompson . LeBron James finished with 30 points , nine rebounds , and seven assists . During the game , James passed Jerry West for 7th on the all - time postseason scoring list . The series will head to Boston for Game 3 on Thursday , where Boston will look to avoid a nearly insurmountable 30 deficit . Boston battled throughout , but was ultimately unable to steal a game on the road . Isaiah Thomas was an offensive catalyst off the bench with 22 points to lead the team in scoring . Thomas also managed to get to the line with some frequency , going 10 - for - 10 from the charity stripe . The only other Celtic with more than two free throw attempts was Evan Turner , who was 3 - of - 4 . There were some positives on the defensive end for Boston , however , as it forced 18 turnovers and held Cleveland to 24 percent from beyond the arc . If Boston can match that effort again on the defensive end in Game 3 , it will give the Celtics a shot to extend the series to at least Game 5 . Cleveland 's stars were the story once again as LeBron James and Kyrie Irving combined for 56 of the Cavaliers ' 99 points . That said , Tristan Thompson 's impact off the bench can not be understated . Thompson finished with 11 rebounds , with six of those boards coming on the offensive end . Timofey Mozgov was also effective before fouling out with 16 points , seven rebounds , and five blocks . The Cavaliers will look to take a commanding 30 lead in the series Thursday in Boston .
The Miami Heat ( 36 - 26 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76er ( 8 - 54 ) 112 - 102 on Friday . As they 've been prone to do on occasion this season , the Sixers give a considerably superior team trouble late into the game . The performance was even more surprising considering that it came on the road , and on a night where Philadelphia sported a depleted roster that was devoid of two of their most talented players . With Nerlens Noel ( knee ) and Jahlil Okafor ( shin ) sitting out , it was up to the likes of Ish Smith and Robert Covington to step up if Philadelphia was going to keep the game competitive . Both players answered the bell , tallying 26 and 25 points , respectively , which helped the Sixers impressively battle back from a 40 - 29 deficit after one quarter . Philadelphia even turned the tables on the Heat in the turnover department , doubling them up by eliciting 16 miscues from them while only committing eight themselves , less than half of their per - night average this season . Smith added eight rebounds , five assists and a steal to his team - leading point tally . Covington supplemented his scoring with five rebounds , three assists , a pair of steals and a block . Hollis Thompson drew the start at shooting guard , and contributed a solid 14 points , six rebounds , two assists , two steals and a block . Richaun Holmes , garnering some extra minutes off the bench with all of the injuries in the frontcourt , paced the reserves with 13 points , eight rebounds , two assists , a steal and a block . The Sixers remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division , and have the worst record in the league . They head down to Miami for the second game of the home - and - home series against the Heat on Sunday . The Heat likely planned to give a much more abbreviated allotment of minutes to their front - line players going in , but all five members of the first unit ended up playing sufficient time to tally double - digit scoring . Dwyane Wade led the field with 21 points , eight rebounds , four assists , three steals and a block . Hassan Whiteside paced the bench and was also the second - highest scorer on the team , tallying 19 points , 19 rebounds , two assists and two blocks over 34 minutes . Goran Dragic continued his recent stretch of outstanding play with a 15 - point , 11 - assist double - double that also included five rebounds and a steal . Luol Deng posted a near double - double , registering 13 points , hauling nine boards and dishing out a pair of assists . Joe Johnson and Amar'e Stoudemire rounded things out with a pair of 12 - point efforts , with the former adding two assists and two steals , and the latter posting four rebounds and a steal . Miami remains atop the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division , and holds the fourth seed in the conference as well . They 're home on Sunday to face off in a return match with the Sixers .
The Magic ( 18 - 13 ) pulled away in the second half to defeat the Pelicans ( 10 - 21 ) 104 - 89 at Amway Center on Monday . Orlando has found success the past month largely due to the effort of Nikola Vucevic , who posted a season - high 28 points on 14 - of - 21 shooting from the field while adding eight rebounds and seven assists over 37 minutes . The Magic shot 55 percent on the night and destroyed the Pelicans in the paint , but were also incredibly efficient from beyond the arc , shooting 7 - of - 17 . The Pelicans got a brief scare in the third quarter when All-Star Anthony Davis went to the locker room after receiving a knee to the groin area . Fortunately he was able to return and finished with a team - high 20 points ( 9 - 16 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 2 - 5 FT ) to go along with eight rebounds . The minor injury caused a down night by Davis 's standards as he had posted at least 24 points and 12 rebounds in his previous three contests . New Orleans did however get a big effort from Norris Cole , who scored a season - high 17 points on 8 - of - 14 shooting with eight rebounds and three assists over 30 minutes . Behind Vucevic were a slew of contributors , including Evan Fournier , who had another nice game shooting the ball Monday . Fournier has hit at least two 3 - pointers in his past four games and is shooting 46 percent from downtown in his past five . The Magic have now won six of their past eight games and are in the thick of the Eastern Conference playoff race with a matchup against the Nets set for Wednesday in Orlando .
The Denver Nuggets defeated the Dallas Mavericks 117 - 107 at Pepsi Center on Monday . The wire - to - wire affair never saw one team pull away from the other , however , the control was mostly in favor of the Nuggets . The Mavericks ( 7 - 21 ) entered the game with an onslaught of injuries facing their lineup , including Dirk Nowitzki ( achilles ) , Andrew Bogut ( knee ) and J.J. Barea ( calf ) . All five Nuggets ( 12 - 16 ) starters finished in double figures scoring , led by Nikola Jokic and his 27 points . The impressive performance from Denver 's power forward also fell just one assist shy of a big triple - double , as he finished with 15 rebounds and nine assists on 13 - of - 17 shooting . Jamal Murray saw 14 minutes of action after dealing with soreness , but only contributed three points on four shots . The injuries have derailed the season for the Mavericks , who will struggle to compete with even the mid - level opponents . The road struggle continues for Dallas as well , who have just one road win on the year . Deron Williams led the team with 23 points , to go along with rebound and eight assists . Harrison Barnes also contributed an efficient effort with 19 points on 9 - of - 15 shooting . Impressively , both teams shot above 50 percent as a unit , but the strong 53 percent effort from the Mavericks was overshadowed by the even more powerful 57 percent effort from the Nuggets . The Nuggets play the second game of a back - to - back when they visit the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday , while the Mavericks visit the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday .
It was an odd statistical night for the Warriors in every sense except the win column on Thursday . The top team in the Western Conference reached the free - throw line only eight times and hit just four of its attempts in the win . Golden State saw an unusual off night from beyond the arc , hitting only nine threes on 28 percent shooting . Reigning MVP and scoring champ Steph Curry had more rebounds than points , ending with a line of eight points , eight assists , and 10 rebounds . Curry shot just 3 - of - 14 on the night . Fellow All-Star Draymond Green had a strangely similar line , shooting 2 - of - 12 for five points to go along with seven assists and 11 rebounds . Former MVP Kevin Durant added 17 points , a team - high 14 rebounds , and yet another eight assists . Golden State finished with a ridiculous 41 assists on 45 shots , just the sixth game ever in which a team assisted on over 90 percent of its shots . For New York , it was a dismal offensive night , as only three players scored in double digits and no starter scored more than 10 . Point guard Brandon Jennings had 10 points to go along with six rebounds and six assists , while bench guard Justin Holiday led the team with 15 points and five steals . The team shot just 40 percent and made only five three - pointers on the night .
The Golden State Warriors fell to the San Antonio Spurs 113 - 100 Thursday at the ORACLE Arena , despite shooting an impressive 54 percent from the field . In the second game of a back - to - back , coach Gregg Popovich uncharacteristically opted to play his veterans , and it paid off in a big way . Tim Duncan had himself a double - double in the contest , with 12 points ( 5 - 13 FG , 2 - 3 FT ) and 13 rebounds ; he added three assists and two turnovers , while turning the ball over once . Tony Parker posted an equally impressive line of 28 points ( 11 - 17 FG , 2 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , seven assists , one rebound , and one turnover in 30 minutes of action . Warriors ' guard Klay Thompson exploded Thursday for 29 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 5 - 6 3Pt , 6 - 6 FT ) . His effort was n't enough , though , as Golden State turned the ball over way too frequently , finishing with a total of 19 as a team . Harrison Barnes chipped in with a season - high 22 points ( 9 - 12 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and Stephen Curry added 16 ( 7 - 18 FG , 0 - 7 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) . Curry did not score in the second half . The San Antonio Spurs attempted an astounding 23 more shots from the field than the Golden State Warriors in this matchup.The Warriors will play next at home against the Brooklyn Nets Thursday , while the Spurs will travel to Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Friday .
The Houston Rockets ( 27 - 25 ) narrowly defeated the struggling Suns ( 14 - 37 ) in Phoenix on Thursday , 111 - 105 . Corey Brewer unexpectedly provided a team - high 24 points for Houston , helping lead the balanced offensive effort the Rockets took in Phoenix . Superstar James Harden scored 17 points , below his average , but also pulled down nine rebounds and dished out six assists . Big man Dwight Howard , meanwhile , was not particularly present in the scoring column ( 5 points ) , but made his presence felt on the boards , tallying 16 rebounds on the night . Overall , Houston had a strong offensive showing , racking up points and hitting 15 three - pointers on the night . Phoenix has seen a steady plummet towards the bottom of the Western Conference following an injury to star point guard Eric Bledsoe . The team 's loss on Thursday was their 21st in 23 games . Despite holding major advantages at the line and on the boards , the Suns struggled offensively , recording 24 turnovers and shooting just 39 percent from the field . Even in the loss , however , rookie standout Devin Booker made himself known with 17 points and four assists . The Rockets will host the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday . Phoenix next sees the court on Saturday as well , as the team will face off against the Utah Jazz .
The Detroit Pistons ( 36 - 34 ) defeated the visiting Brooklyn Nets ( 19 - 50 ) 115 - 103 , at The Palace of Auburn Hills , Saturday . This was the second game of a back - to - back for the Pistons but that has not been a problem for them at all , as they have now won their last six games on the second night of a back - to - back . This was an important win for the Pistons as they remain in competition for the eighth spot in the East . The Nets put up a good fight but the Pistons were more determined down the stretch as they scored 38 points in the final quarter to seal the deal and improve their home record to an impressive 21 - 12 . Seven players scored in double digits for Detroit , as the bench chipped in 52 points to help get over the hump on the second night of a back - to - back .

The Pistons totaled 30 assists on 46 made field goals , while giving up only eight turnovers .

The Dallas Mavericks ( 34 - 33 ) defeated the Charlotte Hornets ( 37 - 29 ) 107 - 96 on Monday . In the midst of a five - game losing streak and with their grip on a Western Conference seed growing increasingly tenuous , Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle decided to call an audible with his starting five against one of the hottest teams in the league . In to the first unit stepped Raymond Felton , sending Zaza Pachulia to the bench for the night . The rather unusual move worked , as Felton hauled in 12 rebounds in addition to contributing nine points , helping to lead Dallas to a much - needed victory that snapped the Hornets ' seven - game winning streak . The Mavericks played stingy defense against a Charlotte team that had been essentially hitting on all cylinders , holding them to a 42 percent success rate from the field , and a 30 percent figure from three - point range . They also elicited 15 turnovers on the night from the home squad , and hung on for the win despite a furious Hornets comeback in the third quarter . Chandler Parsons led the way for Dallas with 24 points , nine rebounds , four assists , three steals and a block . Dirk Nowitzki was right behind him with a 23 - point , 11 - rebound double - double against the Hornets ' vulernable frontcourt . He also added an assist and two blocks . Deron Williams pitched in 15 points , five assists , a steal and a block . Devin Harris and David Lee paced the bench with a pair of 12 - point efforts . The former also supplied two rebounds , an assist and a steal , while the latter pitched in with seven rebounds and a block . The Mavericks remain in third place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division , and have a hold of the seventh seed in the conference as well . They head to Cleveland to face off against the Cavaliers on Wednesday night . As customary , Kemba Walker spearheaded the Hornets ' attack , tallying 25 points , nine assists , four rebounds , two steals and a block . He did , however , commit five turnovers , the sole blemish on an otherwise typically remarkable performance . Nicolas Batum followed with 20 points , seven assists , three rebounds , two steals and two blocks , although he also was guilty of four miscues . Marvin Williams continued his stretch of productive play at power forward , contributing 19 points , seven rebounds and a block . Courtney Lee registered 12 points , three rebounds and two steals . The Hornets are currently in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division , and are presently slotted in the sixth seed in the conference . They 're home again on Wednesday night for a date with the Orlando Magic .
The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Los Angeles Lakers , 122 - 111 , at American Airlines Center on Tuesday . All the talk around this game will be around Dirk Nowitzki and rightfully so . Nowitzki became the sixth player in NBA history to reach 30,0 points , as he did it with a patented Nowitzki fade away . That feat came in a relatively easy win too , as it was a wire - to - wire victory for Dallas , with them leading by double - digits for the final 35 minutes . The Mavericks actually took a 29 - point lead into the fourth quarter , but the Los Angeles starters used that garbage time to cut it to a respectable scoreline . Dallas was lights out from the field , as they shot 52 percent from the field and 55 percent from three - point range . The Mavericks also thrived off turnovers , winning the points off turnover differential , 29 - 14 . The Lakers ( 19 - 45 ) have been one of the worst teams in the league over recent months and this loss was much worse than it looks in the box score . Julius Randle was a bright spot , as he accumulated 13 points , 18 rebounds and 10 assists en route to a triple - double .

The Rockets continued their early season struggles and fell to 5 - 10 , while the Grizzlies improved to 9 - 7 . After starting the season slowly , the Grizzlies have heated up and won six of their last seven games .

The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Brooklyn Nets , 130 - 101 , at AT & T Center on Saturday . The Nets ( 6 - 16 ) have shown perhaps a bit more than was expected of them , even factoring in an injury to key offseason acquisition Jeremy Lin . However , most of their successes have come at home , as they entered Saturday with a 1 - 8 road record . Their futility away from Barclays Center unsurprisingly continued against the stingy Spurs ( 19 - 5 ) , who elicited 16 turnovers from the visitors and held them to 41 percent and 26 percent success rates from the field and three - point range , respectively . Kawhi Leonard also cut right through the heart of the Brooklyn defense , going for 30 points , six rebounds , three assists , a steal and a block . Brooklyn was led Bojan Bogdanovic 's 20 points , which he supplemented with four rebounds and two assists . Brook Lopez was next with 14 points , five boards , five assists and a block .

The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 116 - 108 Tuesday at Target Center . The Timberwolves ( 21 - 35 ) managed to keep pace with the East-leading Cavaliers ( 38 - 16 ) for a majority of Tuesday 's contest , and they were well within striking distance down the final stretch of the game . That was until LeBron James hit a step back three - pointer with two minutes remaining to take his team 's lead from three points to six . At that point , Minnesota was finished . James finished with 25 points on an efficient 10 - of - 14 shooting from the field to go along with 14 assists and eight rebounds as the Cavaliers walked out of the Target Center with their second straight victory and their sixth win in their last seven games . Kyrie Irving added 25 points of his own , Channing Frye posted a double - double of 21 points and 10 rebounds as Kevin Love 's replacement and the newest Cavalier , Derrick Williams , came off the bench to score 13 points Tuesday . As for those Timberwolves , a brilliant performance from Andrew Wiggins ended up not being enough for a team that has lacked a strong supporting cast all season . After scoring 20 points in the third quarter , Wiggins finished the game with 41 points on 16 - of - 29 shooting from the field . Karl-Anthony Towns had yet another productive night as well , scoring 26 points and grabbing eight rebounds , but besides those two , Minnesota failed to get much else offensively from their team . Ricky Rubio did manage to dish out a game - high 16 assists and grab eight rebounds , but he was n't able to produce enough in the scoring column , ending with just five points on 2 - of - 8 shooting from the field .

The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Indiana Pacers , 122 - 100 , at Spectrum Center on Monday . The Hornets ( 5 - 1 ) improved their sterling start to the season with a blowout win against the strong conference opponent in the Pacers ( 3 - 4 ) . The win extends Charlotte 's streak to three games , but they did suffer a setback after Michael Kidd-Gilchrist left the game twice with back soreness . Kidd-Gilchrist returned to the floor after halftime , but his back flared up again and he 'll now be questionable heading into Wednesday 's contest against the Jazz . While the injury did not help the Hornets , it also had little impact on the outcome . Cody Zeller and Marvin Williams had the hot hand in the first quarter , as they both powered their team to an early 18 - point lead with 6:30 remaining in the first quarter . Paul George and C.J . Miles aided the Pacers in cutting that lead to nine points by the end of the first quarter , but Charlotte got back into their groove after pulling away by another 18 - point margin halfway through the second quarter . The story remained the same for the second half , as the Hornets spread the ball , and the scoring efforts , across nine different players . The Hornets saw nine players scoring in double figures on Monday , with Kemba Walker leading the way . The Charlotte point guard finished with 24 points , 10 assists , two rebounds , two steals and one block in an all around fantastic performance that included 7 - of - 11 shooting from the field . Walker buried five three pointers in the win to go along with his game leading stats . Before exiting , Kidd-Gilchrist was a perfect 4 - of - 4 from the field with 13 points , one board and one assist , while Marvin Williams and Cody Zeller pitched in with a combined 25 points and nine rebounds . The Pacers ( 3 - 4 ) simply could not get enough offense moving to match the Hornets pace , and have yet to pick up a win on the road . Paul George finished with 10 points , six assists and seven rebounds , while C.J . Miles had a standout performance off the bench with 23 points in 25 minutes . Both teams play at home on Wednesday , as the Pacers host the Philadelphia 76ers , while the Hornets welcome the Utah Jazz .
The San Antonio Spurs ( 45 - 26 ) blew out the Oklahoma City Thunder ( 41 - 31 ) 130 - 91 on Wednesday . Tony Parker outplayed Russell Westbrook and led his team to victory with 21 points , six assists , six rebounds and three steals in 28 minutes .

They continued there dominant performance in the second half , averaging 30 points in the final two quarters . With the game in hand , the Spurs were able to deploy their bench players into the game early , every San Antonio player played at least 10 minutes . Russell Westbrook took a break from putting up Oscar Robertson numbers for an evening . For just the third time this month he failed to record double - digit assists or rebounds , and for just the second time in March he did n't record 24 points or more . Enes Kanter had a nice game in a losing effort . He matched Westbrook 's 16 points to go along with 10 rebounds in 22 minutes . Mitch McGary had eight points , seven assists , three steals and one block in 23 minutes . His playing time had increased as the Thunder have dealt with injuries to pivotal players such as Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka .

The Thunder will try and regroup before they play the Jazz on Saturday , and the Spurs will host the Mavericks on Friday .
The Detroit Pistons ( 24 - 43 ) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies ( 47 - 21 ) 105 - 95 on Tuesday at the Palace of Auburn Hills . Coming close to playing themselves completely out of the playoffs after losing 10 games in a row , the Pistons gave themselves some hope Tuesday , as they came out with a 10 - point win over the Grizzlies . The win brings them within six and half games of the Miami Heat for the final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference , but they will still need to keep on winning with just 15 games left in the season . The Grizzlies , on the other hand , continue to sit as the second seed in the West , seven games behind the Golden State Warriors , but just one and a half games ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers . They 've lost five of their last ten games now , but they will still likely finish in the top half of the standings if they do n't go on some extended losing streak in the near future . A big part of the win should be attributed to the Pistons ' defense , as they forced the Grizzlies into 18 turnovers , while committing just nine of their own . Reggie Jackson led the way on the offensive side of the ball though , scoring 23 points ( 10 - 18 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) , while also handing out a ridiculous season - high of 20 assists . It was only his third game posting double - digit assists this season , while this arguably marked his best game since joining the Pistons at the trade deadline . Andre Drummond notched a double - double of his own , finishing with 16 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 4 - 6 FT ) , 16 rebounds and five blocked shots . He had suffered a concussion during Saturday 's game , but cleared the concussion protocol prior to this matchup and played as if there were no lingering problems . With Greg Monroe sitting out due to a knee injury , Anthony Tolliver moved into the starting lineup . He took advantage of the start and recorded 15 points ( 4 - 12 FG , 4 - 9 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and seven rebounds . After failing to reach double - digit points in nine straight games , he 's now gone two straight with 14 points or more . Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had a solid shooting effort as well and added 24 points ( 10 - 16 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) in 37 minutes . With Mike Conley sidelined due to an ankle injury , it was the Grizzlies ' frontcourt that had the most production , despite still suffering the loss . Gasol posted a double - double with 17 points ( 6 - 11 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , 11 rebounds and six assists . He had scored less than his season average of 18 points per game in each of his last three outings , so it was good to see the center get back on track Tuesday . Jeff Green was locked in with his shot , going 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 21 points . He 's now pushed his season averages to 15 points and 4 rebounds on the year . Zach Randolph and Vince Carter were the only other players in double figures for points . Randolph finished with 13 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 1 - 1 FT ) and five rebounds , while Carter had 14 points ( 4 - 8 FG , 4 - 6 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and three rebounds off the bench . The Pistons ' next game will be on the road against the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday , while the Grizzlies will travel to Dallas to play the Mavericks on Friday .
The Los Angeles Cippers ( 2 - 2 ) defeated the San Antonio Spurs ( 2 - 2 ) 114 - 105 on Sunday in game four of the first round of the Western Conference playoffs . After losing two games in a row and falling behind the Spurs 2 - 1 in the series , the Clippers did something that most thought might not be possible , they took home a victory on the road in San Antonio . The Spurs are known for being very tough to play at home in the playoffs , but the Clippers were able to get it done and regain home court advantage as they head home to Los Angeles for game five . The Clippers were the superior shooters in this outing , going 54 percent from the field and 28 percent from the three - point line , while the Spurs finished at 44 percent from the field and 24 percent from deep . It was Chris Paul who did most of the damage offensively for the Clippers . He went 11 - for - 19 from the field and 2 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 34 points , while also recording seven assists . He forced his way to the free throw line all game long , converting on all 10 of his free throw attempts . Paul shot just 27 percent to score seven points in Friday 's game three loss to the Spurs , so it was a much needed confidence builder for the guard . Blake Griffin was also dominant in the win , finishing with 20 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 2 - 5 FT ) , 19 rebounds and seven assists . Griffin has recorded a double - double in all four playoff games so far , averaging 22 points and 13 rebounds during that stretch . The biggest surprise during this game was the strong bench play for the Clippers , which has n't been a strength for the majority of this season . In a postgame interview , Paul heaped praise on Austin Rivers . Rivers came off the bench for 16 points , as he shot nearly perfect from the field , going 7 - for - 8 from the floor over 17 minutes . Jamal Crawford also played well off the bench though , scoring 15 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) in 28 minutes . He scored seven of those points in the fourth quarter , as he was a big help in closing out the win . The Spurs were down 14 points with three minutes left in the fourth . They were able to cut the lead down to eight with a minute and a half left , giving the home crowd some hope , but the Clippers were still able to close them out . The Spurs remained close in this game due to their frontcourt duo of Kawhi Leonard and Tim Duncan . Leonard finished with 26 points ( 10 - 19 FG , 3 - 6 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , seven rebounds and five assists , while Duncan recorded an efficient 22 points ( 8 - 13 FG , 6 - 10 FT ) , 14 rebounds and three blocked shots . Duncan had only four points in their game three win over the Clippers , so he was able to have much more success this time around despite playing the very tough defensive bigs of the Clippers . Leonard has been very consistent with his impressive play during this series , as he 's averaging 25 points during the first four games . Tony Parker has had to play through an Achilles injury over the past few games , but he was able to fight through the pain in this one and posted 18 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt , 4 - 8 FT ) , to go along with just one assist over 28 minutes . With Parker playing a smaller amount of minutes , Patty Mills saw some increased playing time off the bench , as he recorded 14 points , while shooting 4 - for - 10 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line . These two teams will play again on Tuesday in Los Angeles for game five of this best - of - seven series .
The Houston Rockets ( 30 ) escaped with a 130 - 128 win over the Dallas Mavericks ( 0 - 3 ) . Monta Ellis missed the game - tying 19 - foot jumper just before the buzzer sounded . This performance marks the first time since 1994 a team scoring at least 128 points in a non - overtime playoff game didn’t come away with the win . MVP candidate James Harden hit the game - clinching jumper over the Mavericks’ Tyson Chandler with 12 seconds remaining . The bucket gave him a playoff career - high 42 points to go along with nine assists , five rebounds , one steal and five three - pointers in 36 minutes . Dwight Howard played 38 minutes and grabbed 26 rebounds , more than half the team’s 46 boards . He was one of five players on the Rockets not names James Harden to score at least 12 points , a unit led by Josh Smith’s 18 points in 27 minutes off the bench . Without Rajon Rondo and Chandler Parsons , both done for the rest of the postseason , the Mavericks held firm with a combined 68 points from Monta Ellis and Dirk Nowitzki . Ellis recorded playoff career - highs of 34 points and nine assists in 39 minutes . Nowitzki pulled the Mavericks to within one with 33 seconds left by converting three free throws , but it wasn’t enough . Raymond Felton started for the ailing Rondo , but he was held scoreless in 13 minutes with the team deferring to Ellis as the primary ballhandler . J.J. Barea and Devin Harris combined for 21 points and 11 assists off the bench . After converting 91 percent of their free throws in the first two contests , the Mavericks sank 27 - of - 35 from the charity stripe . The series resumes Sunday night .

The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the visiting Portland Trail Blazers , 115 - 95 , in Game 1 of the Western Conference first - round playoffs Sunday at Staples Center . The opening games to the opening round of the 2016 NBA Playoffs closed with another rout , this time it belonged to the Clippers . Heading into the series , some analysts pegged the Blazers and Clippers series to be the toughest of the first round in terms of the Western Conference , but Chris Paul and Blake Griffin played fantastic basketball and handled Damian Lillard’s group with relative ease in Game 1 . Los Angeles built upon a five point first quarter lead incrementally through the remainder of the game . The second half proved to be on the side of interminable length after Terry Stotts elected to foul DeAndre Jordan , and although the big man finished 8 - of - 18 from the charity stripe , the strategy failed after the Blazers shooters could not get a clean look at the basket . Portland was swarmed by Los Angeles , and even when they broke through the double team , they were unable to finish at the rim . Paul finished with 28 points , six rebounds and 11 assists on 10 - of - 19 shooting , while Griffin played the best game since returning from injury and contributed 19 points , 12 rebounds and six assists . Jordan had a block party while he patrolled the paint and added 18 points , 12 rebounds and four blocks . JJ Reddick played more inside the arc , but the strategy paid off , as he shot 8 - of - 12 from the floor on only three attempts from the three - point line on his way to 17 points in the contest . The Clippers shot 53 percent from the floor as a unit and outrebounded the Blazers 48 - 40 in the win . The prevention of Damian Lillard from heating up , in combination with C.J . McCollum’s inefficient shooting , put the game out of reach for Portland early in the second half . It seemed as though every pull up shot was contested and there was no easy way to get a bucket for Portland . Lillard finished with 21 points and eight assists , while McCollum could only pitch in nine points on 11 shots . Gerald Henderson showcased his athleticism , but even the acrobatic forward could found it tough to finish at the rim , as he added 16 points on 7 - of - 12 shooting in just under 30 minutes off the bench . Game 2 is scheduled for 7:30 PM Eastern Time on Wednesday in Los Angeles .
The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Toronto Raptors 108 - 106 Tuesday at AirCanada Centre . The Spurs ( 36 - 9 ) came into Tuesday 's matchup without Pau Gasol ( finger ) , Kawhi Leonard ( hand ) and Tony Parker ( foot ) , but it did n't matter . Even without three regular starters , San Antonio was able to hold off a struggling Raptors ( 28 - 17 ) team , who remains without their All-Star shooting guard DeMar DeRozan ( ankle ) . In the absence of three stars , LaMarcus Aldridge stepped up with a solid performance , recording a team - high 21 points on 6 - of - 14 shooting from the field to go along with seven rebounds . Patty Mills then added 18 points in 30 critical minutes off the bench . Overall , it was n't the prettiest performance from San Antonio , as they shot just 45 percent from the field and 29 percent from behind the arc , but they still managed to notch their fifth straight victory . As for the Raptors , they continue to struggle , as they have now lost four games in a row after winning four in a row just before that . They had a prime opportunity to end that streak against a banged up San Antonio team , but while Kyle Lowry and the Toronto backcourt managed to take advantage , the frontcourt players struggled to do so . Lowry finished with a game - high 30 points and five rebounds , while Terrance Ross and Norman Powell added 21 and 16 points , respectively . The team 's start frontcourt , however , made up of Jonas Valanciunas , Jared Sullinger and DeMarre Carroll combined to score a grand total of just 11 points . Ball disruption was the ultimate problem , however , as the team managed just 10 assists to their 10 turnovers . Up next , the Spurs will try to make it six straight wins Friday in New Orleans , while the the Raptors will look to end their losing streak when they take on the Grizzlies on Wednesday .

On opening night for both teams , the Hornets held off the Bucks 108 - 106 in overtime . Milwaukee got off to a hot start , shooting nearly 53 percent from the field en route to a 57 - 46 halftime advantage . A Brandon Knight-led run early in the third quarter pushed the lead up to 24 points , but the new - look Hornets would fight back . Charlotte outscored Milwaukee 32 - 15 in the final period , slowly chipping away at the lead by stifling the Bucks’ ballhandlers on the defensive end .

A pair of Jabari Parker free throws gave the bucks the early overtime lead , but with the game tied at 106 with 16 seconds left , Charlotte again looked to Walker . He sized up Knight at the top of the key and connected on a tough , step - back jumper to give Charlotte a 108 - 106 advantage with five seconds remaining .

What the Cavaliers did especially well was limit mistakes , as they committed just eight turnovers and allowed the Pacers to record just three combined blocks and steals . Despite Indiana shooting a better percentage from three , the Cavaliers lived there , going 18 - of - 39 from long distance in their win .

The Brooklyn Nets ( 7 - 15 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 1 - 22 ) 100 - 91 on Thursday for their second consecutive home victory . The story of the game turned out to be the two teams ' big men , who both put together atypical performances as compared to their recent efforts . Sixers center Jahlil Okafor had endured a rough last two weeks , posting three lackluster performances before serving a two - game suspension earlier this month for off - the - court scuffles on Thanksgiving Eve . He then was relegated to the bench in his first game back Monday , and shot 3 - for - 14 from the field during an embarassing 119 - 68 beatdown at the hands of the Spurs . Thursday , Okafor came back with a vengeance , responding with a 22 - point , 10 - rebound double - double over 31 minutes . Meanwhile , Lopez got into foul trouble and therefore was limited to just 19 minutes , leading to his worst overall outing of the season . The eight - year veteran was held to single - digit scoring for the first time in the 2015 - 16 campaign , posting seven points , seven rebounds , an assist and a block during his limited time on the court . Okafor was actually the only starter for the visitors that was able to tally double - digit points , as the majority of support he received came from the bench in the form of T.J. McConnell and Richaun Holmes . McConnell collected 17 points and added a rebound , an assist and three steals , while Holmes managed double - digit scoring for the third time in the last four games ( 14 points ) . Nerlens Noel and Robert Covington could only pitch in a pair of six - point efforts , while Isaiah Canaan struggled through a 2 - for - 10 shooting night on the way to only four points . The one other bright spot in the starting five was Tony Wroten , who continued his comeback from January knee surgery by posting a season - high nine points , along with four rebounds , a pair of assists and a steal over 17 minutes . It was the third time in his three games this season that Wroten has increased his time on the court , as he works his way back to a starter 's allotment of minutes . The Sixers dropped to 1 - 22 and remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division with the worst record in the league . They head home for a date with the Detroit Pistons on Friday . The Nets used a 30 - 19 fourth quarter to come back from a 74 - 70 deficit entering the period . With Lopez spending large chunks of time on the bench , it was veteran big man Andrea Bargnani , making his return from a four - game absence due to a hamstring injury , that posted a season - high and game - high 23 points . Bargnani added six rebounds and an assist over a highly productive 23 minutes . Thaddeus Young was solid once again despite being without his customary frontcourt mate for a large part of the game , collecting his fourth consecutive double - double with 18 points and 11 rebounds . Bojan Bogdanovic pitched in with his second consecutive double - digit scoring game , amassing 10 points , three rebounds , and three assists , along with another pair of his trademark three - pointers . Like fellow reserve Bargnani , Shane Larkin also made significant contributions off the bench , tallying 14 points , six assists , four rebounds and a steal over an efficient and stat - sheet - stuffing 27 minutes . Brooklyn improved to 7 - 15 and remains in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They remain home for a Saturday afternoon showdown against the Clippers .
The Oklahoma City Thunder ( 24 - 10 ) routed the Hornets ( 17 - 16 ) in Charlotte on Saturday , 109 - 90 . The Thunder have been on a tear of late , picking up 13 of their last 15 games . After a mediocre start , OKC has established themselves comfortably as the third - ranked team in the Western Conference , and have slowly been gaining on the second seed San Antonio Spurs , who currently rank dead last in strength of schedule . 2014 MVP Kevin Durant led the way for the Thunder with a 29 - point scoring performance . Durant paired the impressive points total with 11 rebounds and four blocked shots , contributing to the Thunder 's impressive 15 total blocks . All-NBA point guard Russell Westbrook showcased his skill too , posting a well - rounded stat line of 16 points , six rebounds , and seven assists . The dynamic duo of Durant and Westbrook has been elecrtic this season , as both players rank in the top four in the league in scoring . The Hornets , meanwhile , got off to a blazing hot start this season but have slowed down recently . Charlotte is now just 7 - 9 in the month of December and have dropped three straight games . Star point guard Kemba Walker , however , has not wavered in the face of the losing streak . Walker delivered a dominant 32 points , which he coupled with three steals on the defensive end . Walker 's effort was not enough , however , as the team was held to just 35 percent shooting from the field on the night . OKC will hope to continue playing winning basketball as they prepare to take on the Sacramento Kings on Monday . Charlotte , on the other hand , will face a tough challenge as they take to the road against the 30 - 2 Golden State Warriors on Monday .
The Oklahoma City Thunder ( 47 - 22 ) defeated the Philadelpia 76ers ( 9 - 60 ) 111 - 97 on Friday . The Thunder could have easily been tempted to think a playoff spot was in the bag coming into Friday night , considering that all they needed to do was take care of business against an overmatched Sixers squad . However , as has been the case on several occasions this seasons , Philadelphia proved to be a tough out for a considerable portion of the game against a vastly superior opponent . The Sixers hung with the Thunder well into the third quarter , and did get a boost with the return of Jerami Grant ( concussion ) to the starting five . The hapless home squad also turned the tables on the visitors in the turnover department , eliciting 20 from the Thunder and commiting only eight themselves . Ultimately , however , Russell Westbrook 's league - leading 13th triple - double and Kevin Durant 's double - double were too much for the Sixers , and helped lead Oklahoma City to victory . Durant finished with 26 points , 13 rebounds , six assists and a block , although he did account for a quarter of the turnovers for the Thunder . Westbrook was guilty of committing five miscues himself , but more than made up for it by supplying 20 points , 15 rebounds , 10 assists , two blocks and a steal . Steven Adams also tallied a double - double , which consisted of 12 points , 11 boards , three blocks and an assist . Enes Kanter paced the reserves with 16 points , seven rebounds and a block , although he handed the ball over to the opposition a team - high six times . The Thunder remain in first place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division , and currently hold the third seed in the conference as well . They hit the road again for a date with the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night . The Sixers ' starters were led by Hollis Thompson 's 16 points , which he complemented with four rebounds , three assists and a pair of steals . Grant pitched in with 15 points , seven rebounds , two assists and three blocks . Nerlens Noel managed a near double - double with 12 points , nine boards , two assists , a steal and two blocks . Isaiah Canaan registered 10 points , four rebounds , two assists and three steals . Nik Stauskas paced the reserves - - and the team as a whole - - with 23 points , four rebounds , three assists and three steals over 34 minutes off the bench . The Sixers remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division with the worst record in the NBA . They 're home again Sunday for a date with the Boston Celtics .
Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns overpowered the Kings defense in a rather easy road victory for Minnesota , a team that 's been far from strong on the road this season . Wiggins finished with 27 points , four rebounds and one assist on 10 - of - 22 shooting , while Towns added 29 points , 17 rebounds , two assists and three blocks . Nemanja Bjelica put up a strong bench performance in his 35 minutes , as he posted 10 points and 12 boards . All five Kings starters did finish in double figures in scoring , with three tying for the team lead of 14 points . Kosta Koufos , Ben McLemore and Willie Cauley-Stein each had 14 points , while Darren Collison and Ty Lawson pitched in 10 points and 11 points , respectively . Newcomer Tyreke Evans played 25 minutes off the bench and scored 13 points , to go with five rebounds and two assists .
The Orlando Magic ( 15 - 11 ) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers ( 11 - 17 ) 102 - 94 on Friday . The Trail Blazers came into Friday 's contest with one of the worst defensive frontcourts in the NBA , surrendering a league - worst average of 22 points and 17 rebounds to opposing centers . This troubling trend for Portland was on full display Friday , with the Magic 's Nikola Vucevic tallying 25 points and 11 rebounds for his ninth double - double performance of the season . The Orlando center made a season - high 22 shot attempts , draining 12 of them for a solid 55 percentage from the field . Meanwhile , forward Tobias Harris pitched in with his own 25 - point double - double , and added 12 boards . Orlando completely dominated the contest down low , outscoring Portland by a resounding margin of 52 to 18 in the paint and outrebounding them 48 to 42 . Portland was led by a valiant effort from C.J . McCollum , who drained 11 of 19 shots on his way to a game - high 27 points . The third - year pro added six assists and a pair of rebounds . Backcourt mate Damian Lillard was solid as well , although he slogged through an atypical 4 - for - 15 shooting performance . Lillard did tally 19 points , but it was a total that was significantly supplemented by the nine free throw attempts that he successfully converted . Al-Farouq Aminiu had his most prolific scoring night in nearly two weeks with 16 points , an amount he reached with the help of a season - high four three - pointers . Allen Crabbe paced the Portland bench with the only other double - digit scoring effort on the team , amassing 14 points and adding four rebounds and an assist . The Trail Blazers fell to 11 - 17 and remain in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They head to Miami to face the Heat on Sunday .

The second - year pro managed 19 points , six rebounds , three assists , a pair of steals and a block , while visiting the free throw line a season - high 17 times . Victor Oladipo was also outstanding off the bench , pouring 15 points and adding six assists , four rebounds , three steals and a block over a robust 35 minutes . The third - year pro was pressed into extended action after starting shooting guard Evan Fournier sustained a dislocated pinkie finger and thus was limited to only 22 minutes . The Magic improved to 15 - 11 and currently reside in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They remain home for a date with the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday .
The Pistons have been a different team at home this season and much of it is reliant on their defense . Not only are they 50 at Palace of Auburn Hills , they are allowing just 85 points a game at home this season . Three-point shooting killed the Thunder , as they went just 5 - of - 27 in the defeat . Without Andre Drummond , Aron Baynes had his best game of the season , recording a season - high 20 points and eight rebounds . Jon Leuer and Beno Udrih were very effective off the bench , combining for 18 points , 13 rebounds and eight assists in the win . Victor Oladipo continues to struggle in a Thunder uniform , as he scored just nine points on 4 - of - 17 shooting in the defeat . Russell Westbrook did all he could to keep Oklahoma City in the game , as he accumulated 33 points , 15 rebounds and eight assists .
The Detroit Pistons defeated the Charlotte Hornets , 112 - 89 , at Spectrum Arena on Tuesday . The Pistons ( 9 - 10 ) checked in to Tuesday 's contest with an unsightly 1 - 8 road record , a sharp contrast to the 7 - 2 mark they 've compiled at the Palace at Auburn Hills . However , Tobias Harris took matters into his own hands , ensuring that Detroit would stop the bleeding away from home , at least for a night . He tallied a team - high 24 points and supplemented it with seven rebounds , two assists , two blocks and a steal . He was aided by a pair of 18 - point efforts from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Marcus Morris , which helped make up for a forgettable outing from Andre Drummond , who played just 13 minutes and scored three points on 1 - of - 6 shooting . Overall , the Pistons enjoyed one of their better shooting nights of the season , posting a 49 percent success rate from the field , while also limiting the Hornets ( 10 - 8 ) to sub - 40 percent tallies from both the field and three - point range .

Cody Zeller registered a modest eight points but did haul in 10 rebounds . Nicolas Batum and Frank Kaminsky could only combine for 10 points , although Batum also brought in 11 boards and dished out five assists .

However , they came out for the second period with a renewed sense of purpose , which almost carried them to a significant upset . The Hawks had whittled the Cleveland down to 74 - 70 by that point , and found themselves with an 80 - 79 lead , their first of the game , after an Al Horford dunk of an alley - oop pass from Dennis Schroder with eight minutes remaining in regulation .

The Los Angeles Lakers ( 3 - 9 ) defeated the Houston Rockets ( 9 - 3 ) 98 - 92 on Wednesday at the Toyota Center in Houston . The Lakers have now won two games in a row , stealing a surprising four - point victory on the road in Houston . Without Dwight Howard , who sat out with a knee injury , the Rockets did n't have their usual presence inside the lane , and were out - rebounded 47 - 38 . They also were out - scored 28 - 17 in the fourth quarter , as the Lakers closed out strong and sealed the victory . As always , the Lakers were led by their superstar Kobe Bryant . Bryant shot 10 - for - 28 from the field and a dismal 1 - for - 7 from the three - point line , but still scored 29 points , while adding seven assists . He got a boost in scoring from the free - throw line though , as he converted on 8 - of - 10 . In his second game back from a thumb injury , Nick Young was able to put up solid numbers again . He scored 16 points off the bench , as he shot 6 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 8 from beyond the arc . The Lakers frontcourt of Jordan Hill and Carlos Boozer were both big in the victory , with each posting a double - double of their own . Hill had 16 points and 10 rebounds , marking his fourth double - double in as many games . Boozer finished with 12 points and 13 rebounds , as he posted his second double - double in a row . For the Rockets , James Harden posted a very efficient 24 points ( 7 - 11 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 8 - 10 FT ) , while also handing out seven assists . He 's now averaging 24 points , 7 rebounds and 7 assists on the year . Starting at point guard , Patrick Beverley was able to score 15 points , equaling a season - high for him .

He went 6 - for - 10 from the field and 4 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score 19 points , while also grabbing six rebounds . He 's only reached double figures in scoring twice this year , so it was a nice surprise for the Rockets . Trevor Ariza was the only other player in double - digits , as he had 13 points and seven rebounds . The Lakers ' next game will be on the road against the Dallas Mavericks on Friday , while the Rockets will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday .
The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Chicago Bulls , 117 - 89 , at Target Center on Sunday afternoon . The Bulls ( 26 - 29 ) came in to Sunday 's contest at a significant disadvantage , considering that Jimmy Butler ( heel ) , Dwyane Wade ( wrists ) , Nikola Mirotic ( back ) and Paul Zipser ( ankle ) were all out of commission . That left Chicago with a tight rotation of 10 players , not to mention a major offensive void . The handicap spelled disaster against a Timberwolves ( 21 - 34 ) squad at full strength that ambushed their visitors out of the gate by a 34 - 17 first - quarter margin . Although the Bulls battled back in the second period , the cushion afforded by that lead was enough to carry the hosts the rest of the way . Chicago also committed 18 turnovers , further hampering their chances at keeping matters competitive . The rather unlikely duo of Doug McDermott and Bobby Portis led the way for the Bulls with matching 16 - point efforts , with the former adding two assists and one rebound and the latter also supplying six boards . Michael Carter-Williams pitched in with 12 points , seven rebounds , six assists and two steals . Robin Lopez provided 10 points , four rebounds , two assists and one block , while Rajon Rondo matched Lopez 's scoring total and added six assists , three rebounds and one steal in 24 minutes off the bench . Jerian Grant totaled eight points , three assists , a rebound and a block , and Taj Gibson , the only other member besides Carter-Williams and Lopez to take the court , tallied two points , five rebounds and one assist . Andrew Wiggins paced the Timberwolves with 27 points , six boards , four assists , two steals and one block . Karl-Anthony Towns followed with 22 points , seven boards , four assists and one steal . Ricky Rubio turned in a 17 - point , 11 - assist double - double that also included six rebounds and two steals . Nemanja Bjelica led the bench with 16 points , six rebounds , three assists , two steals and one block in 19 highly efficient minutes . Shabazz Muhammad was productive as a reserve as well with 12 points , two rebounds and one steal . Gorgui Dieng posted a 10 - point , 13 - rebound double - double that also included two steals and one block . The Bulls return home to face off with the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday evening , while the Timberwolves remain home to do battle with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday night as well .
The Portland Trail Blazers ( 36 - 34 ) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans ( 25 - 43 ) 117 - 112 on Friday . A wild back - and - forth battle featured plenty of offensive fireworks , most coming from the ususal suspects on either squad . Portland 's dynamic duo of Damian Lillard and C.J . McCollum put together a pair of 30 - point - plus performances , while Jrue Holiday bounced back from a pair of lackluster games to hit that number as well . The fourth member of the 30 - point club was a Pelicans power forward , but not the one most likely to achieve the mark . It was notably Ryan Anderson , and not Anthony Davis , that accomplished the feat , in an outstanding 37 minutes off the bench . As has happened on multiple occasions this season , Davis was forced to exit the game early with an injury , suffering a left knee ailment that prevented him from taking the floor in the second half . Despite having held a lead as large as 20 points and not having to face Davis over the final two quarters , the Trail Blazers were forced to fight until the final whistle , as the Pelicans mounted a furious comeback . Holiday 's clutch 26 - foot three - pointer with four seconds remaining kept things interesting until the very end , and it was n't until McCollum drained two subsequent free throws with one second remaining that Portland was able to breathe easy . Lillard 's 33 points paced the visitors , and he added eight rebounds , six assists and a block . McCollum followed closely behind with 30 points , six assists and three rebounds . Mason Plumlee was next among the starters with 11 points , six rebounds and four assists . Gerald Henderson paced the reserves with 19 points , six rebounds and a steal . Ed Davis was productive in a reserve role as well , posting a 10 - point , 10 - rebound double - double . He added a pair of blocks and a steal . The Trail Blazers remain in second place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division , and are currently in the sixth seed in the conference as well . They head to Dallas to face off with the Mavericks on Sunday . Holiday paced New Orleans with 30 points , six assists , two rebounds and two steals . Davis managed 19 points and a rebound in only 14 minutes before exiting with his injury . Toney Douglas was productive in another start , totaling 12 points , six assists , a rebound and two steals . Anderson paced the reserves with his 30 - point scoring total , and added seven rebounds , three assists and a block . New Orleans remains in last place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division and is 10 games behind the eighth - seeded Dallas Mavericks . They 're home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday .
The Golden State Warriors ( 35 - 2 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 15 - 22 ) 128 - 116 on Saturday . The Warriors extended their win streak to six games through excellent ball movement and selfless basketball , which has become a staple to their improved season . It was the fifth time over the last six games that Golden State eclipsed 30 assists in a game , as they passed their way to 35 total dimes . Stephen Curry is making the strongest case to defend his MVP title and led all scorers with 38 points , 11 assists and six rebounds on 12 - of - 21 shooting . Curry added eight more 3 - point shots to his NBA leading 162 treys . Klay Thompson is currently second amongst all deep threats , but was not nearly as effective as his backcourt partner , and finished 1 - of - 7 from behind the arc . Thompson was effective late in the game , hooking up with Andrew Bogut for some devastating backdoor cuts and added 15 points , four rebounds and six assists . Draymond Green is becoming accustomed to rounding out the box score , and although Green did not capture his ninth triple - double of the season , he did finish with 25 points , nine assists and four rebounds on 8 - of - 12 shooting in 34 minutes . Harrison Barnes was reserved to the bench and is being given slightly more minutes , as he eases his way back after missing 16 games with an ankle injury . The UNC product shot the ball much better in his 24 minutes , adding 10 points on 4 - of - 7 shooting . The Warriors will welcome the Miami Heat ( 22 - 15 ) on Monday . Sacramento mounted a late comeback to pull the game within striking distance in the 4th quarter to pad the 12 points loss , as DeMarcus Cousins found his stroke from beyond the arc . Cousins went 2 - of - 6 from 3 - point territory , but the two that fell came at clutch moments . The Kings’ star center scored 33 points , in addition to 10 rebounds on 12 - of - 27 shooting . Rudy Gay contributed on the scoring front and poured in 23 points in a game high 38 minutes , while Darren Collison and Marco Belinelli scored double figures off the bench . Willie Cauley-Stein ( finger ) was probable before the game , but suited up and added 10 points in nine minutes . The return of the Kings first round draft pick provides some extra depth , especially on the defensive end , for Sacramento moving forward . The Kings will take a few days off before hosting the New Orleans Pelicans ( 11 - 24 ) on Wednesday .
The New Orleans Pelicans ( 40 - 34 ) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers ( 20 - 54 ) 113 - 92 on Wednesday . Anthony Davis put on another show and the Lakers did n't have an answer for him . He had 20 points , seven rebounds , six assists , four blocks and one steal in 35 minutes . He got some big bench contributions from Ryan Anderson and Norris Cole , who each scored 17 points . Tyreke Evans has continued to relish his role as the Pelican 's point guard , he had 16 points and eight assists with zero turnovers in 28 minutes . He 's put up averages of 20 points and 8 assists over his last five games . New Orleans has won three straight and hope to dethrone the Oklahoma City Thunder for the final playoff spots in the Western Conference . The Lakers got a solid performance from Jordan Clarkson but got little help from teammates , as they currently do n't have a go - to guy . Clarkson led Los Angeles with 18 points and 10 assists to go along with seven rebounds in 31 minutes . The Lakers have an eye on the future as the season rolls to an end in just a couple weeks . The Lakers will host the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday , as the Pelicans will play in Sacramento against the Kings .
The host Golden State Warriors blew out the injury - riddled Utah Jazz on Tuesday , 104 - 74 . Golden State ( 25 - 4 ) remains the league 's top team thanks to the win . The Warriors have now won five straight and sit atop the Western Conference , though San Antonio sits just one game back from the lead . On Tuesday , the sailing looked as smooth as ever for the Golden State `` superteam , '' as former MVPs Steph Curry and Kevin Durant combined to score 47 . All-Star forward Draymond Green , meanwhile , had 15 points and 11 assists , as well as five steals on the defensive end . All-Star Klay Thompson also had 17 . The Jazz ( 18 - 11 ) had won four straight before being blown out on Tuesday . Utah remains hampered by major injuries , as starters George Hill and Derrick Favors were forced to sit out the game in Oakland . It was nothing short of an awful offensive performance for the depleted team , as the Jazz shot just 35 percent from the field and turned the ball over 23 times . Despite the team 's intense struggles , big man Rudy Gobert continued to dominate , recording a game - high 16 rebounds and shooting 5 - of - 6 on the night . The Jazz will host the Kings on Wednesday , while Golden State will travel to Brooklyn to face the Nets on Thursday .
The Utah Jazz ( 8 - 7 ) held off the New Orleans Pelicans ( 4 - 13 ) 101 - 87 on Saturday . Utah had a 16 - point lead going into the fourth quarter and it 's nearly impossible to beat this stingy defense with that sort of deficit . The rebounding was the big difference in the game , as the Jazz snatched 49 boards compared to 35 for the Pelicans . These are teams going in opposite directions and the Jazz proved tonight that good defense will always prevail . New Orleans came into this game as the worst defense in the NBA and the 101 points allowed is a significant improvement on those ugly numbers . It 's still not good enough to win and it does n't look that great when you notice that Utah currently has one of the three - worst offenses in the league . New Orleans got a fantastic game out of Anthony Davis though , as he tallied 36 points , 11 rebounds , three blocks and two steals in the loss . The more amazing part about that game is that it 's one night after being carried off the floor with a knee injury . What hurt the Pelicans on this night was the rest of the starters , as the four others combined for just 14 points , six rebounds , and five assists . That 's almost a nearly identical line to what Ish Smith provided off the bench on Saturday as well , and the Pelicans simply need more from their other starters . New Orleans will have to take on another potent defense when they play the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday . The Jazz played this game without Derrick Favors and they did n't miss a beat . Favors missed the game for an unknown personal reason , but Trevor Booker filled - in spectacularly . Booker amassed 13 points , 15 rebounds , three assists , three blocks and two steals in the win . Alec Burks was also fantastic off the bench , as he led the team with 21 points and provided an additional five rebounds and four assists . This is a dominant defense , so when players like Booker and Burks can produce like this , they 'll be tough to beat . Utah will play the undefeated Golden State Warriors on Monday in their next scheduled game and it should be a great test for this defense against the best offense in the NBA .
This win for Boston completed the season sweep over Indiana , as the Pacers have now traded off wins and losses across their last 15 games .

Isaiah Thomas led Boston with 25 points and five assists . Avery Bradley amassed 18 points and eight rebounds . Jae Crowder and Al Horford both scored 15 points , with Horford also providing eight rebounds and eight assists .
The recent form of these teams would indicate an easy Atlanta win and that was just the case . In fact , the Hawks pulled out a wire - to - wire victory , as they held a double - digit lead for the final 30 - plus minutes . Defense was key , as they held Brooklyn to 40 percent shooting , while forcing 17 turnovers . Much of that was attributed to the 11 steals and 12 blocks the Hawks recorded . Dennis Schroder led Atlanta , tallying 20 points and 10 assists . Dwight Howard played just 27 minutes , but totaled 14 points and 16 rebounds . Paul Millsap provided 14 points , eight rebounds , four assists and three blocks . Brook Lopez led the Nets in scoring , as he dropped 20 points in an otherwise empty stat line .

Miami have been the hottest team in the league over the past two months , as this marks their 22nd win in 27 games . More importantly , it put the Heat in a tie with the Milwaukee Bucks for the eight - seed in the east . Rebounding was the biggest difference in the game , with Miami winning that battle , 45 - 38 . Anthony Davis led the way for New Orleans , as he collected 27 points , eight rebounds , three steals and three blocks . DeMarcus Cousins amassed 19 points and nine rebounds . E'Twaun Moore led the bench , as he dropped 18 points . Goran Dragic returned from his eye injury to tally 33 points and five rebounds to lead the team . Hassan Whiteside totaled 20 points and 17 rebounds on 9 - of - 11 shooting . The bench was huge , as Wayne Ellington , James Johnson and Tyler Johnson all scored in double figures , while combining for 39 points , nine rebounds , 14 assists and four steals .
One night after engaging in a triple - overtime game that lasted just under three hours , the Brooklyn Nets defeated the Indiana Pacers in regulation , 123 - 111 . The Nets were the sixth team to win a game the second night of a back - to - back after playing multiple overtimes the night before . Rodney Stuckey exited early due to a sore left calf , playing just 13 minutes in the first half .

The Detroit Pistons ( 20 ) won their second game in a row to start the regular season , defeating the Utah Jazz ( 0 - 1 ) 92 - 87 on Wednesday . The meeting stayed close wire - to - wire , and the Pistons held just a five - point lead at the start of the fourth quarter . Following a Gordon Hayward layup that put the Jazz up 87 - 86 with just 23 seconds left in the game , Detroit was able to counter quickly , as Reggie Jackson made a layup of his own with 17 seconds left that put the Pistons up for good .

The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Orlando Magic , 120 - 101 , at Amway Center on Wednesday .

In fact , they outscored Orlando , 35 - 13 in the third quarter , as the Magic simply could n't recover from that blow .

The new - look Cavaliers are certainly playing up in pace under new coach Tyronn Lue , but an unintended consequence of their more prolific offense has been increased vulnerability on defense .

Such was the case Wednesday , with the Lakers managing one of their best scoring hauls of the season .

The Sacramento Kings defeated the Boston Celtics , 108 - 92 , on Wednesday at Golden 1 Center . The Kings ( 21 - 32 ) came into Wednesday 's contest with a plethora of injuries , missing the likes of Rudy Gay ( Achilles ) , Omri Casspi ( foot ) and Garrett Temple ( hamstring ) . However , to make matters worse , DeMarcus Cousins picked up his 15th and 16th technical fouls a game prior , which prompted a one - game suspension , thus ruling out the team 's best player . While the Kings were n't expected to even keep the game close , they fought through the adversity and picked up an impressive 16 - point win in front of their home crowd . Much of the credit can be given to Darren Collison , who blew up for 26 points , while shooting 12 - of - 21 from the field and 2 - of - 4 from the three - point line . To go along with the aforementioned points , Collison also added one rebound , five assists and four steals . Sacramento 's bench also came up big , outscoring the the Celtics ' reserves , 50 - 32 . That included three double - digit scoring efforts from the likes of Ben McLemore ( 17 ) , Willie Cauley-Stein ( 14 ) and Matt Barnes ( 14 ) . As a team , the Kings shot 50 percent from the field and 40 percent from beyond the arc , which easily bested the Celtics ' 40 percent and 31 percent success rates , respectively . Isaiah Thomas did everything he could to keep the Celtics ( 33 - 19 ) alive , posting 26 points ( 6 - 16 FG , 4 - 11 3Pt , 10 - 10 FT ) , four rebounds and seven assists . He did n't shoot the ball at a high clip , but he got it done at the free throw line , as he connected on all 10 of his attempts . The only other two starters to reach double figures were Amir Johnson and Al Horford , who posted 14 and 10 points , respectively . Perhaps it was the uncertainty of the opposing team , but the Celtics just could n't keep up with the injury - depleted Sacramento team . The Celtics were once again without Avery Bradley , who 's now expected to miss the team 's upcoming four - game road trip with a lingering Achilles injury . Up next , the Kings will remain at home to play the Atlanta Hawks on Thursday , while the Celtics will remain on the road with a trip to Portland , where they 'll be taking on the Trail Blazers .

The 16 points and 12 rebounds for Rondo marked his second double - double in a Chicago uniform . Strangely enough , he 's yet to reach double - digit assists in any game this season , after leading the league in that category last year .

The Washington Wizards ( 38 - 40 ) defeated the Brooklyn Nets ( 21 - 57 ) 121 - 103 on Wednesday . The Wizards announced earlier in the day that John Wall would miss the game to rest a sore right knee , particularly relevant considering the must - win situation that Washington found itself in to keep their playoff hopes alive . As it turned out , they got by just fine without their All-Star against a Nets squad that was undermanned in its own right .

Wayne Ellington was next among the starters , managing 14 points , four rebounds and an assist .

Washington remains in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division , but remains 4 games behind the eighth - seeded Pistons , who also won Wednesday . They face off with the Pistons in Detroit on Friday night .
Before Tuesday night 's game against the Magic , Trevor Ariza had been serving as an offensive liability for the Rockets . Over his previous eight games , he had failed to score in double figures six times and was shooting just 23 percent from the field and 24 percent from behind the arc over the course of those eight games . Against Orlando , however , Ariza found a way to shoot himself completely out of that slump . The wing shot 4 - of - 9 from behind the arc and 7 - of - 15 from the field overall to put in 20 points Tuesday - - his highest scoring total since Jan. 15 . And while Ariza is primarily known for his prowess on the defensive end , if he can consistently hit a high percentage of his jump shots like he did Tuesday night , it only makes the Rockets more dangerous .
The Sacramento Kings ( 24 - 25 ) routed the visiting Washington Wizards ( 40 - 30 ) ,109 - 86 on Sunday at the Sleep Train Arena . Sacramento simply outplayed Washington for much of the game and really started to pull away in the third .

Bradley Beal was the only Wizard in double figures until midway through the third and finished with a team - high 19 points . Sacramento built a large lead over Washington when they met last Saturday , but was intent on not letting the lead slip away this time as they evened the season series at one game apiece . Washington 's four - game road trip got off to a promising start Wednesday with a hard fought victory over Utah , but has since sputtered out with two straight losses . John Wall had a poor outing by his standards , going 3 - for - 10 from the field to end up with nine points in 33 minutes of action . Kris Humphries missed Sunday 's game and has not played since late February . Washington has an opportunity to salvage this road trip with a big game Monday against Golden State .

San Antonio has lost four straight games during a stretch of their schedule that 's seen them face off against the Western Conference 's elite teams ( Trail Blazers twice , Grizzlies and Mavericks ) .

San Antonio will try to stop the bleeding when they host the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday .
The New York Knicks defeated the Indiana Pacers 109 - 103 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Monday . Carmelo Anthony finally got a game winning jumper to fall after a handful of failed attempts though January , and the Derrick Rose assisted baseline fadeaway with :23 remaining in the fourth quarter was enough for New York ( 20 - 26 ) to come away with a road victory . The Pacers ( 22 - 22 ) made one crucial error that put the game away for the Knicks , as Myles Turner mishandled a pass resulting in a turnover following Anthony 's go - ahead jumper . Courtney Lee was able to add on to the Knicks lead with seconds remaining from the free throw line to put the game away for good . Myles Turner had a series on the defensive end of the floor where he blocked a Derrick Rose transition layup and then followed up by going coast - to - coast to put back a misfired shot from the Pacers . Save for Turner 's costly error at the end of the game , the young Indiana center went on to score 22 points and grab 10 rebounds , to go along with two blocks .

LeBron James and company stayed unbeaten in the NBA Playoffs thus far , improving to 90 and storming out to a 22 - point halftime lead , which held up through the remainder of the game , to take Game 1 on their home court . The Raptors were coming off their biggest win in franchise history , and the back - to - back seven game series looked like it took its toll on the team . Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan were hounded by the Cavs guards and forwards throughout the whole game , and even when the backcourt duo got a clean look , they were unable to get into a rhythm , especially from behind the arc . Kyrie Irving continued to play his role as a scorer while the offense ran through LeBron James . J.R. Smith was running up and down the length of the court with impressive play on both ends of the floor as well . James stuffed the stat sheet , and it only took 28 minutes of action , as he finished with 24 points , six rebounds , four assists , two steals and one block on 11 - of - 13 shooting , while Irving led all scorer with 27 points , to go along with two boards and five dimes . Kevin Love was the only other Cavaliers player to finish in double figures , as he added 14 points , but four bench players ( Iman Shumpert , Richard Jefferson , Matthew Dellavedova and Channing Frye ) all contributed 8 - plus points . Irving barely eclipsed the 30 minute mark , which also led all Cavaliers players , but the starters sat throughout the fourth quarter . Lowry and DeRozan seem to be the make or break factor for the Raptors to compete in the Playoffs , but only DeRozan was able to get into a shooting rhythm , while the rest of the team looked abused with the Cavaliers matchups . The Toronto shooting guard scored 18 points on 9 - of - 17 shooting , but Lowry finished with eight points , four boards and five assists on 4 - of - 14 shooting ( 0 - of - 7 from behind the arc ) . The Raptors were unable to find a scoring option off the bench either , save for James Johnson , who muscled his way to 10 points in 20 minutes of play . Toronto is still awaiting Jonas Valanciunas ( ankle ) return to the lineup , which might have to wait until Game 3 or 4 of the series , but his absence is proving vital to the Raptors chances . The Raptors will look to even the series in Game 2 on Thursday .
The Atlanta Hawks ( 24 - 17 ) handed the Brooklyn Nets ( 11 - 30 ) their 12th loss in 13 games Saturday , 114 - 86 . Atlanta was emphatic in its victory , outscoring Brooklyn 30 - 18 in the fourth quarter . The Hawks were a pinnacle of ball - movement in Saturday 's game , recording 34 assists on the night and hitting 56 percent of their attempts from the field . Six Hawks scored in double digits , with forward Paul Millsap leading the way with 21 points . Backup point guard Dennis Schroeder , meanwhile , exploded off the bench for 15 points , 10 assists , and six rebounds . The team also had a strong outing on the defensive end , stealing the ball 14 times in total . Brooklyn 's loss marks the continuation of the team 's slide towards the bottom of the NBA totem pole . The Nets have lost 12 of their last 13 , and have also had to deal with the resignation of GM Billy King and the firing of coach Lionel Hollins . Despite the Nets ' woes , forward Thaddeus Young has played solid basketball , which he continued on Saturday . Young led the Nets with 18 points and added seven rebounds and two steals . Brooklyn will visit Toronto on Monday . The Hawks , meanwhile , will be visited by the Orlando Magic on Monday .
The Los Angeles Clippers ( 45 - 25 ) defeated the Washington Wizards ( 40 - 29 ) 113 - 99 at the Staples Center on Friday . The Clippers took the lead two minutes into the first quarter and held on for the rest of the game , dominating behind the three - point line and on the glass . The Clippers shot 52 percent from three - point range and pulled down 46 boards , while the Wizards shot 32 % from behind the arc and had only 36 rebounds . Chris Paul led the Clippers in scoring with 30 points ( 12 - 21 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt ) to go with six rebounds , 15 assists and one steal . J.J. Redick contributed 26 points ( 9 - 15 FG , 4 - 7 3 Pt ) , and Blake Griffin had 22 points ( 10 - 19 FG ) . John Wall had a team - high 19 points ( 7 - 18 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt ) for the Wizards .

The Wizards are fifth in the Eastern Conference and one game behind the Raptors . The Clippers avoided the series sweep on Friday , going 1 - 3 against the Wizards this season .
The Portland Trail Blazers ( 16 - 24 ) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder ( 26 - 12 ) 115 - 110 on Sunday . The Thunder shot the ball more efficiently than the Blazers and looked to rip off a strong run behind the highest scoring duo in Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant , but the high power offense came up just short , as Damian Lillard drained back - to - back 3 - pointers late in the 4th quarter . While Durant was heating up , primarily on strong ball movement lead by Westbrook , the Thunder tried to pull away by double - digits in the 3rd and 4th quarters , but the Blazers simply hung around for long enough to turn the momentum in their favor . Oklahoma City received almost the entirety of their offense from the starters , as the bench provided a lowly 16 points combined from Dion Waiters , Enes Kanter and Cameron Payne . Kevin Durant led the Thunder with 28 points , to go along with six rebounds and four assists , while Russell Westbrook added 25 points , 15 assists ( 10 dimes in the first half ) and nine rebounds . Steven Adams hauled in a double - double , as he contributed 17 points and 10 rebounds , while Serge Ibaka and Andre Roberson finished in double - figures to round out the starting five . Billy Donovan did not rely on his bench and only Dion Waiters eclipsed 20 - plus minutes on a reserved role , as the starters all played 30 - plus minutes in the contest . The Thunder will continue their road trip when they visit the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 12 - 26 ) on Tuesday . Damian Lillard did not back down from the difficult matchup against Russell Westbrook , and knocked down the game tying and go ahead 3 - pointers to earn the comeback win . The Blazers were battling uphill throughout the majority of the game and it came behind sub - 40 percent shooting through three quarters of play . The 4th quarter was an entirely different story , and when Lillard gets a hot hand , he can be one of the deadliest deep ball shooters in the league . The all star point guard finished with 31 points on 9 - of - 18 shooting ( 8 - of - 14 from 3 - point territory ) , to go along with seven rebounds and nine assists . C.J . McCollum poured in 22 points to aid the scoring , adding four 3 - pointers of his own . Mason Plumlee pitched in 11 points and 11 rebounds , while Allen Crabbe and Ed Davis ( knee ) contributed double figures from the bench . Portland has been one of the bigger surprises this season , after many predicted them to have one of the league’s worst records after the departure of LaMarcus Aldridge , the Blazers improved to 9 - 9 at home and are approaching 20 wins before the all - star break . The Blazers will host the Utah Jazz ( 17 - 20 ) on Wednesday .
The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the San Antonio Spurs 116 - 92 at Staples Center on Saturday . The Clippers ( 5 - 1 ) took advantage of a major scoring drought at the hand of the Spurs ( 5 - 2 ) from the 9:0 mark to the 3:0 point of the first quarter , where San Antonio was only able to salvage one basket during that period . The Clippers went on a scoring run anchored by Blake Griffin , who went on to score 16 points in the opening period . Los Angeles maintained their strong start throughout the second quarter , and entered the half with an 18 point lead . The Spurs were unable to cut into the lead in the second half , as the Clippers rallied behind impressive bench performances from Marreese Speights and Jamal Crawford . Griffin led the way for Los Angeles with 28 points , five rebounds and three assists , while Chris Paul almost notched a triple - double with nine points , eight rebounds and 10 assists . Speights and Crawford combined for 31 points on 10 - of - 18 shooting . San Antonio struggled with their shooting efficiency and finished just over 40 percent as a unit . LaMarcus Aldridge has the standout performance amongst his teammates with 19 points and six rebounds , while Kawhi Leonard has a quiet night with just 14 points , six boards and one assist . Once the blowout was too much for San Antonio , coach Gregg Popovich started to utilize the depth of his bench and rotated eight different players off the bench into the game . No one player on the Spurs played more than 28 minutes . Next up , the Clippers host the Detroit Pistons on Monday , while the Spurs get some time off before Spurs host the Rockets on Wednesday .
The Miami Heat ( 10 - 5 ) defeated the New York Knicks ( 8 - 9 ) 97 - 78 on Friday . Gerald Green 's first season in a Heat uniform has been anything but dull . The veteran has managed to overcome recent personal problems to serve as an integral part of the Miami bench , as well as a terrific spot starter . Green filled in at small forward for Luol Deng for a second consecutive contest and propelled the Heat to a road victory with a team - high , game - high , and season - high 25 points . The particularly remarkable aspect of his performance was the fact that Green had only tallied only 5 points by intermission . However , a second - half offensive barrage that included three of his four three - pointers on the night helped Miami significantly extend what had been a razor - thin 50 - 49 halftime lead , and cruise to an eventual 21 - point win . Green 's effort was complemented nicely by Chris Bosh , who managed 20 points , five rebounds , three assists and a block . Dwyane Wade pitched in with 17 points , five rebounds and a trio of assists . Hassan Whiteside had his worst shooting night of the season , going only 1 - for - 6 from the field , making it his first single - digit scoring night in over two weeks and only the fourth game in which he has scored under 10 points . However , the standout center did haul in 14 boards , the third consecutive game in which he 's hit double - digit rebounds . Rookie Justice Winslow received a robust 35 minutes off the bench , and although he was n't terribly efficient with them , he did round out the stat sheet nicely . The Heat 's 2015 first - round pick finished with nine points , seven rebounds , an assist and a steal . The Heat improved to 10 - 5 and are in possession of first place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They remain home for a date with the Celtics on Monday . The Knicks were thoroughly stymied by Miami 's suffocating defense , shooting only 38 percent from the field for the game and barely seeing two of five starters crack double - digit scoring . Carmelo Anthony was one of those players , but the superstar small forward could only muster 11 points , three rebounds , an assist and a steal over 34 minutes . It tied the veteran 's season - low scoring total , which he 'd posted in the opener versus Milwaukee . Kristaps Porzingis matched Anthony 's 11 points and added eight rebounds , two steals and three blocks . Robin Lopez , Arron Afflalo and Jose Calderon-the rest of the starting five - - only totaled eight points between them . Reserve forward Kevin Seraphin was the only other New York player to reach double figures , tallying 10 points , three rebounds and an assist over a very efficient 17 minutes . The Knicks fell to 8 - 9 and currently reside in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They remain home for a date with the Rockets on Sunday .
Statistics are a strange thing and they 're even more bizarre when looking at this box score . The Bucks actually won the shooting percentage , rebounding battle , fastbreak points , points in the paint and assist - to - turnover ratio differentials , despite losing the game . No team led by more than 10 points , but there were only five ties and four lead changes . DeMar DeRozan once again carried the Raptors , as he tallied 26 points , seven rebounds and four assists . Kyle Lowry finished with 19 points , five rebounds and six assists , hitting numerous big shots late to cap the win . Giannis Antetokounmpo continued his MVP form for the Bucks , accumulating 29 points , six rebounds and 11 assists in the defeat . Both benches struggled in this game , with Toronto getting 28 bench points to Milwaukee 's 24 . These two teams will have a rematch on December 12 in Toronto .
These are two teams that have been struggling mightily , but the Grizzlies have been the better team this year and they showed why in this game . The assist - to - turnover ratio was the big difference , as the Grizzlies recorded 25 assists to just eight turnovers , while the Pistons matched their assists to turnovers at 17 a piece . Marc Gasol was the only Memphis player with more than 10 points , as he tied a career - high with 38 points . Gasol also added five rebounds , four assists , two steals and two blocks on 14 - of - 17 shooting to his impressive stat line . Reggie Jackson departed the game in the first three minutes due to a leg injury , but returned to lead the Pistons with 18 points and seven assists . Jon Leuer also dropped 18 points , as he added six rebounds off the bench . Andre Drummond recorded another double - double , totaling 13 points and 19 rebounds in the defeat .
As has become the usual for Sacramento , superstar center DeMarcus `` Boogie '' Cousins led the way in just about every area for the Kings . Cousins posted team highs in points , rebounds , assists , and steals , with 22 , 14 , six , and two respectively . The impressive numbers came on what was a relatively `` off '' night for the star , as he shot just 8 - of - 21 from the field and 5 - of - 8 from the free - throw line with six turnovers . Sixth man Ty Lawson was dominant off the bench , posting 19 points and six assists in just 23 minutes . Detroit 's bench , meanwhile , did it no favors . While typical starter Tobias Harris scored 15 , the remaining backups combined for only 15 themselves . Two starters posted double - doubles , as center Andre Drummond scored 14 with 12 rebounds , and point guard Reggie Jackson scored 18 to go with 11 assists .
DeMar DeRozan 's 18 - foot basket with one second remaining proved to be the game - winning shot , as Carmelo Anthony 's 25 - foot three - point jumper at the buzzer failed to find the net , clinching Toronto 's hard - fought road win . DeRozan compiled a game - high 37 points , while Serge Ibaka was a distant second with 15 points . Jonas Valanciunas totaled 10 points , while DeMarre Carroll supplied nine . Cory Joseph , now presumably the starting point guard for the remainder of the campaign due to Kyle Lowry 's wrist injury , contributed a modest six points , four assists , three rebounds and two steals over 34 minutes . Anthony paced the Knicks with 24 points . Derrick Rose and Courtney Lee were next with matching 16 - points efforts . Lance Thomas drew another start for Kristaps Porzingis and registered 12 points . Willy Hernangomez posted eight points , nine boards and two assists .
The Pistons utilized a balanced offensive attack and a stingy defense to record their first road victory against the Nuggets . All five members of the starting five reached double - digit scoring , led by Tobias Harris ' 19 points . The remainder of the first unit , Marcus Morris , Andre Drummond , Ish Smith and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope , combined for another 55 points , while Jon Leuer posted a 14 - point , 10 - rebound double - double off the bench . All of the strong offensive performances led to a 51 percent success rate from the field for Detroit . The Nuggets received double - digit scoring efforts from Danilo Gallinari , Emmanuel Mudiay and Gary Harris , but also saw Jusuf Nurkic held scoreless over 17 minutes . Jameer Nelson was the only bench player to hit double digits in the scoring column , although forward Wilson Chandler did manage to haul in 10 rebounds .
The Toronto Raptors ( 39 - 18 ) defeated the visiting Cleveland Cavaliers ( 41 - 16 ) 99 - 97 , Friday night at Air Canada Center . The Raptors came into this one three games behind the Cavs for first place in the East and made a statement by grinding out a win after trailing by 14 with four minutes left in the third . DeMar DeRozan had a tough game , starting 0 - 10 from the field before leaving mid - way through the third with flu - like symptoms . Kyle Lowry then put the team on his shoulders , scoring 16 of his career - high 43 points in the fourth quarter . With Lowry 's help the Raptors outscored the Cavs 31 - 20 in the final quarter . This win means that Toronto takes the three - game season series against Cleveland , 2 - 1 . Toronto has now won 18 of its last 21 games and four in a row . This win marks a single - season , franchise - high , 10th straight home victory for Toronto and improves their home record to 21 - 6 . DeRozan actually returned to the game midway through the fourth quarter , where he scored his only bucket of the game , contributing to a 90 run by Toronto that tied the game with three minutes left . DeRozan finished with six points , six rebounds , two assists and one steal , in 32 minutes . Kyle Lowry was lights out as he tallied a career - high 43 points on 15 - of - 20 shooting from the field , including 2 - 5 from deep and 11 - 15 free throws . He also contributed nine assists , five rebounds and four steals , in 43 minutes . Terrence Ross chipped in 15 points ( 6 - 11 FG , 3 - 6 3Pt ) , two rebounds and one assist , in 27 minutes off the bench while , Jonas Valanciunas was solid in the middle as he racked up 11 points and nine rebounds , in 28 minutes . Toronto has now won 26 games in a row when they hold their opponents below 100 points . LeBron James led the Cavs in scoring with 25 points ( 9 - 18 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 5 - 9 FT ) , along with eight rebounds , seven assists but gave up six turnovers , in 40 minutes .

Smith chipped in 13 points ( 5 - 8 FG , 3 - 6 3Pt ) , along with three rebounds , in 32 minutes . The Cavs shot 50 percent from long distance and 47 percent from the field over all but it was not enough to avoid their fifth loss under coach Lue . Next , the Cavs visit Washington to challenge the Wizards on Sunday . The Raptors head to Detroit to face the Pistons on Sunday . The Raptors will be looking their fifth straight win .
The Dallas Mavericks proved to be too much to handle for the Sacramento Kings Tuesday night at the America Airlines Center , winning 106 - 98 . The Kings got off to a fast start , led by Rudy Gay , accumulating a lead as high as 24 points in the first half . Dallas promptly responded though , battling back to cut the deficit to nine , as the buzzer sounded signifying the end of the second quarter . Gay tallied a line of 26 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 11 - 13 FT ) , eight rebounds , eight assists , and two steals while turning the ball over seven times . Monta Ellis was held scoreless in the first half , but was a huge factor in the second half finishing with 16 points ( 7 - 16 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 1 - 3 FT ) . Maverick 's superstar Dirk Nowitzki registered a team - high 23 points ( 7 - 12 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 7 - 8 FT ) , seven rebounds , three assists , and a block with two turnovers . The future hall of famer certainly did the heavy lifting Tuesday , against a Kings team looking to regain their form after a tough loss against the Oklahoma City Thunder Monday . Thursday , the Dallas Mavericks look ahead to their next game against the Philadelphia 76ers while the Sacramento Kings will go on the road Thursday to take on the Memphis Grizzlies in their next matchup .
The Sacramento Kings ( 16 - 22 ) fell to the Dallas Mavericks ( 27 - 12 ) on Tuesday at the Sleep Train Arena 108 - 104 . The Kings looked to be on their way to closing this game out late in the fourth quarter after surrendering just 10 points to the Mavericks through the first ten minutes of the period . However , thanks to some clutch throw shooting and an offensive foul from DeMarcus Cousins , Dallas was able to send this contest to overtime . Recently acquired Rajon Rondo drained the go - ahead three with just over a minute to go in the overtime period to give the Mavericks a lead they would not relinquish . Dallas snapped its two - game losing skid in a tight game that went down to the wire . Monta Ellis led the Mavericks in scoring with 28 points and he added 10 assists . The Mavericks have a quick turnaround as they will travel to Denver to take on the Nuggets on Wednesday . Sacramento had a chance to win consecutive games for the first time since late November , but came up short . The Kings were n't able to survive overtime without their best player , Cousins , who fouled out late in the fourth . Sacramento was also without Rudy Gay for most of the game after he suffered a sprained knee in the first quarter . He is considered day - to - day at this point . The Kings will have a couple of days off before hosting the Heat on Friday .
The Indiana Pacers ( 37 - 43 ) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder ( 43 - 37 ) 116 - 104 on Sunday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis . While Russell Westbrook did everything he could to bring the Thunder back in this game , he just did n't get enough help in the end , as the Thunder took the loss . This was a tough defeat for the Thunder , as it pushes them to a half - game back from the New Orleans Pelicans for the final projected playoff spot in the West . The Pelicans play the Houston Rockets on Sunday as well , so they could extend their lead to a full game . The Pacers , on the other hand , remain alive in the East with their fifth straight win . They 're now even with the Brooklyn Nets for the final playoff spot in the East , although the Nets hold the tie breaker over them , so they 'll likely need to win their last two games in order to pass up the Nets . It was C.J . Miles who came up with the huge night on Sunday . He went 9 - for - 14 from the field and 6 - for - 8 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 30 points , while also posting 10 rebounds . It was his second impressive performance in a row , as he 's combined for 54 points and 15 rebounds over his last two games . The 10 rebounds were a new season - high , with the double - double marking his first of the season . Notching a double - double of his own was Roy Hibbert , who finished with 17 points ( 7 - 12 FG , 3 - 4 FT ) , 10 rebounds and two blocked shots . The double - double was his third in a row , a stretch where he 's averaging 13 points and 11 rebounds per game . Including some clutch buckets during the final few minutes of the game , George Hill added 19 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 5 - 7 FT ) and seven assists over 40 minutes . He shot just 2 - of - 6 from the field in Friday 's game against the Pistons , so the guard was able to get pointed back in the right direction Sunday . Westbrook did everything he could to try and pick up the win for the Thunder . Westbrook took nearly half of the teams ' total shot attempts in this one , recording a ridiculous 43 field goal attempts , while converting on 21 of them . He finished with a monster line of 54 points ( 21 - 43 FG , 5 - 15 3Pt , 7 - 11 FT ) , nine rebounds and eight assists over 40 minutes , but he just did n't get enough help from his teammates to convert those impressive numbers into a win . Westbrook has combined for 81 points over his last two games alone . Dion Waiters and Enes Kanter were the only other two Thunder players to reach double figures in points . Waiters posted 16 points ( 7 - 16 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 0 - 4 FT ) and two rebounds , while Kanter recorded 13 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) , five rebounds and a block . The Thunder received only 14 points from their bench . The Pacers ' next game will be at home against the Washington Wizards on Tuesday , while the Thunder will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday .
The Golden State Warriors ( 51 - 12 ) defeated the Detroit Pistons ( 23 - 40 ) 105 - 98 on Wednesday in Oakland . The Warriors were able to open up their lead in the fourth quarter behind Klay Thompson , who finished with 27 points on 11 - of - 19 shooting . Thompson 's running mate in the backcourt , MVP-candidate Stephen Curry , struggled shooting the ball in the victory and finished with just nine points on 11 - of - 10 shooting , but was still able to dish out 11 assists . Draymond Green and Andrew Bogut combined for a solid effort in the frontcourt , putting together 25 points and 13 rebounds between the two of them . Andre Iguodala ( 13 ) , Marreese Speights ( 12 ) , and Leandro Barbosa ( 10 ) all scored in double figures off the bench for Golden State . The win brings the Warriors ' lead as the one - seed in the Western Conference to a commanding 7 games . Andre Drummond was a force in the paint for the Pistons in the losing effort , scoring 22 points on 11 - of - 25 shooting and grabbing 27 rebounds , 17 of them offensive , in 34 minutes . Greg Monroe also had a solid outing , recording 20 points on 7 - of - 18 shooting and nine rebounds in 32 minutes . After having just two points and three assists in his last outing , Reggie Jackson bounced back to put up 14 points on 7 - of - 15 shooting and nine assists . Caron Butler replaced Tayshaun Prince in the starting lineup , but only scored four points in 20 minutes . The loss further hurts Detroit 's already slim playoff chances , as they currently sit six games behind the eighth - place Miami Heat . Up next , the Warriors will head to Denver Friday to take on the Nuggets , while the Pistons will travel to Portland Friday to go up against the TrailBlazers .
The Houston Rockets defeated the host Washington Wizards 114 - 106 at Verizon Center on Monday . The game was tight throughout , as neither team led by more than 11 points while the lead changed hands 25 times . The Wizards held a 95 - 94 advantage with 6:45 left , but the Rockets used a 120 run to put it out of reach with just a few minutes left . Shooting was the big difference , as Houston shot 52 percent , while holding Washington to just 42 percent on their end . The Rockets played efficiently as well , as they assisted on 28 of their 41 made baskets . The Rockets ( 4 - 3 ) continue to blitz opponents with their up - tempo offense , and the Wizards simply could n't keep up with them . James Harden led the team with 32 points , 15 assists and six rebounds . Ryan Anderson had one of his best games in a Houston uniform , recording a season - high 23 points and seven boards on 9 - of - 15 shooting . Trevor Ariza provided 15 points , five rebounds and three steals of his own . The Rockets return to action on Wednesday , when they travel to San Antonio to face the Spurs . The Wizards ( 1 - 5 ) continue to be one of the disappointments of the league , as they melted down in their own building . John Wall led the team in scoring with his 21 points , five rebounds and eight assists , but picked up his second technical in the final minute of the game to get ejected . Bradley Beal had one of his best games of the year , totaling 20 points , three assists and four steals in the defeat . Marcin Gortat recorded a double - double , amassing 14 points and 12 rebounds . Otto Porter tallied 20 points , eight rebounds and three steals . Washington will look to play better on Wednesday , when they host the Boston Celtics .
The Boston Celtics ( 39 - 42 ) defeated the Toronto Raptors ( 48 - 33 ) 95 - 93 on Tuesday at the TD Garden in Boston . Down two points with just over 10 seconds left in the game , Kyle Lowry brought the Raptors back to tie the Celtics after a driving layup . It was the Celtics who came out with the last laugh though , as Jae Crowder hit a clutch jump shot with just under a second left in regulation to pull out the victory . It was a solid victory for the Celtics , as they 're now going to go into the playoffs as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference standings , meaning they 'll take on the Cleveland Cavaliers during the first round . The Raptors , on the other hand , moved down into the fourth seed in the East , a game behind the Chicago Bulls , which would mean they could end up playing the fiffth - seeded Washington Wizards in their first playoff matchup . It was the duo of Avery Bradley and Evan Turner that had the biggest impact in securing the win Tuesday . Turner nearly came out with a triple - double , finishing with 14 points ( 7 - 14 FG ) , seven rebounds and nine assists . It was n't all good for the forward though , as he did record seven turnovers as well . He 's combined for 29 points and 14 assists over his last two games , and he 'll need to continue to play well if the Celtics want any chance at pulling off an upset during the playoffs . Bradley recorded 14 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) of his own , to go along with three rebounds and two assists , but he ended up suffering a left quad contusion and was forced to leave the game . He 'll likely sit Wednesday 's finale out in order to get healthy for their first playoff matchup . Brandon Bass and Tyler Zeller were the other two starters in double figures . Bass finished with 13 points ( 4 - 11 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) and nine rebounds , while Zeller added 12 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) and eight rebounds . For the Raptors , Kyle Lowry went 6 - for - 20 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the three - point line to match a team - high of 16 points , while also recording six rebounds and four assists . Lowry has really struggled with his shot lately , combining to go just 9 - for - 34 from the field over his last two games , so he really needs to get things turned around if the Raptors want to have some success in the playoffs . Despite struggling with his shot similar to Lowry , Louis Williams still posted 16 points ( 3 - 13 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt ) , as he was able to get to the free throw line 11 times , while converting on 10 - of - 11 . Williams continues to be a great offensive option off the Raptors ' bench , averaging 21 points over his last six games . Jonas Valanciunas nearly came up with a double - double , posting 10 points ( 4 - 8 FG , 2 - 4 FT ) , eight rebounds and two blocked shots , while Greivis Vasquez chipped in with 11 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 3 - 6 3Pt ) , five rebounds and seven assists . The Celtics will close out the regular season on the road against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday , while the Raptors will be at home against the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday .
Avery Bradley hit a game - winning three - pointer at the buzzer as the Boston Celtics ( 30 - 22 ) stunned the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 35 - 16 ) on their home court on Friday , 104 - 103 . The Celtics have won eight of their last nine . The young squad has been one of the hottest team 's in the NBA in the new year , and is tied for third in the East . All-Star Isaiah Thomas led the scoring effort against the Cavs , finishing with 22 points . Of course , it was guard Bradley who was the star of the show . Bradley played hard - nosed defense and finished with 14 points including the deep game - winner . After five straight wins , the Cavs have now stumbled a bit , dropping their last two contests . Cleveland shocked the league by firing head coach David Blatt despite sitting atop the Eastern Conference standings .

The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Memphis Grizzlies , 99 - 88 , at FedEx Forum on Friday . The Grizzlies ( 3 - 3 ) typically make their opponents grind for every point , and Friday was no different . The Clippers ( 4 - 1 ) struggled for the second straight game , with one notable exception . Chris Paul supplied a team - high 27 points , while also dishing out a season - best 11 assists and notching six steals for a second consecutive contest . The scoring total was greatly aided by a game - high 15 trips to the free - throw line , with Paul parlaying all but one into points . With the other four members of the first unit combining for just 36 points and the team posting 38 percent and 30 percent success rates from the field and three - point range , respectively , the All-Star guard 's contributions were particularly essential in securing the road victory . Blake Griffin was second behind Paul with a 14 - point , 10 - rebound double - double , and he added two assists and a steal . J.J. Redick posted 12 points , a rebound and two steals . While DeAndre Jordan poured in just six points , he hauled in a season - high 21 boards , 15 of which came on the defensive glass .

The Detroit Pistons ( 40 - 35 ) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder ( 52 - 23 ) Tuesday night at the Palace of Auburn Hills , 88 - 82 . With the Thunder now locked into the Western Conference 's third position , Oklahoma City took the opportunity to rest Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka . Their offense clearly suffered in their absence , as the Thunder committed more turnovers ( 19 ) than assists ( 16 ) and scored a meager nine points in the third quarter , which allowed Detroit to turn a 48 - 46 halftime deficit into a 71 - 57 lead heading into the fourth quarter , more than enough to stave off a final push from the Thunder . Marcus Morris scored 24 points on an efficient shooting night ( 9 - 13 FG , 1 - 1 3PT , 5 - 5 FT ) to lead the Pistons . Tobias Harris scored 17 ( 6 - 14 FG ) and added seven rebounds and three assists . Andre Drummond added his league - leading 62nd double - double with 13 points ( 6 - 9 FG ) and 15 rebounds . Detroit shot just 4 - 19 ( 21 percent ) from three - point land and 38 percent overall , but they pulled down 16 offensive rebounds to produce just enough offense to win . The scoring load for the Thunder fell squarely on Russell Westbrook 's shoulders , as he hoisted up 28 shots and tied Morris 's game - high 24 points ( 8 - 28 FG , 2 - 8 3PT , 6 - 9 FT ) . Enes Kanter added a double - double with 14 points and 14 rebounds ( six offensive ) , but not a single other Thunder player reached double figures . Oklahoma City shot just 38 percent from the floor and missed eight free throws ( 14 - 22 , 64 percent ) as they clearly missed Durant 's presence . The Pistons next host the Mavericks on Friday . The Thunder return home to host the Clippers on Thursday .
The Mavericks ( 23 - 10 ) beat the Wizards ( 22 - 9 ) in blowout fashion Tuesday by a score of 114 - 87 .

The Mavericks shot lights - out , hitting 52 percent from the floor and 53 percent from beyond the arc . Dallas had six players score in double figures , led by Monta Ellis with 20 points . Washington was coming off of a tight game Monday against the Rockets that came down to the final minute . That certainly did n't help their cause as the Wizards were out of contention for much of this game . Washington is an even 1 - 1 on their Western Conference road trip but will get two days off before taking the floor again Friday against the Thunder . Dallas has won three straight . They have the next two days off before starting a road trip that begins against the Boston Celtics on Friday .
The host Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Phoenix Suns 124 - 121 at Moda Center on Wednesday . Despite the Blazers pulling out a rare wire - to - wire win , this game was close throughout . The Suns trailed by one with just five seconds left , but the Blazers closed things out with some clutch free throws . Portland was lights - out with their jumpers , shooting 56 percent from the field and 45 percent from three - point range . Damian Lillard and C.J . McCollum carried the load , as they combined for 71 points , 11 rebounds and 10 assists in the win . Phoenix ( 2 - 6 ) has gotten off to a rough start this season , but they continue to hang around in every game .

Eric Bledsoe was Phoenix 's best player , totaling 31 points , four rebounds and four assists , with 15 of those points coming in the fourth quarter . Four bench players scored in double figures , as Dragan Bender , Brandon Knight , P.J . Tucker and Leandro Barbosa combined for 42 points . Tucker was very important off the bench , accumulating 11 points , nine rebounds , four assists and five steals . The Suns play again on Wednesday , when they host the Detroit Pistons for their next game . Portland ( 5 - 3 ) were expected to dominate this game , but it was closer than fans would hope . Damian Lillard and C.J . McCollum did everything they could though , as they each scored 30 - plus in dominating performances . Lillard led the team with 38 points , five rebounds and three assists . McCollum was n't far behind , as he tallied 33 points , six rebounds and seven assists of his own . Maurice Harkless was third on the team , with 20 points and six boards .

The Houston Rockets ( 8 - 4 ) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers ( 7 - 7 ) 113 - 100 in Game 7 of their second - round playoff series on Sunday in Houston and have won the series . The Rockets were in full control of the game from start to finish . The Clippers had their runs , closing the gap to as low as three points at one point in the third quarter , but they could never get over the hump and Houston had little trouble sealing the deal , closing out the series and advancing to the Western Conference Finals . Following the Game 6 victory where he didn’t play a single minute in the fourth quarter , James Harden had a masterful performance , scoring a game - high 31 points ( 7 - 20 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 15 - 18 FT ) to go along with seven rebounds , eight assists and three steals in 43 minutes . Trevor Ariza was an absolute sharp shooter from behind the 3 - point line Sunday afternoon , shooting 6 - of - 12 from behind the arc and scoring 22 points along with seven rebounds in 43 minutes . Dwight Howard posted yet another double - double , totaling 16 points ( 6 - 8 FG , 4 - 8 FT ) and 15 rebounds in 32 minutes ; this third straight double - double and seventh in his last eight games . Mid-season acquisitions Josh Smith ( 15 ) and Corey Brewer ( 11 ) round out the five Rocket players who scored in double figures . The Clippers’ loss means the franchise still has yet to make a Western Conference Finals in their history , and the loss occurred at the hands of an epic collapse . Even though Chris Paul is the undisputed leader of the team , he is not to fault for the loss , as he played his heart out in the losing effort . Paul finished with 26 points ( 9 - 20 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt ) , five rebounds , 10 assists and four steals in 45 minutes . Blake Griffin led the team in scoring , recording 27 points ( 13 - 23 FG ) , 11 rebounds and six assists in 44 minutes .

Redick ( 10 ) round out the five Los Angeles players who scored in double figures . The Clippers could have used more out of Matt Barnes , who after playing solidily throughout the entire playoffs , was held scoreless in 22 minutes of play . With the win , Houston completed an incredible comeback after finding themselves down 3 - 1 in the series and have now earned the right to play in the Western Conference Finals . They will go up against the Golden State Warriors , who they played four times during the regular season and lost all four meetings .
The Miami Heat ( 35 - 43 ) defeated the Charlotte Hornets ( 33 - 44 ) 105 - 100 on Tuesday at American Airlines Arena in Miami . With just four games left in the season following this one , this was another huge win for the Heat , who have now moved just a half game back from the Boston Celtics for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings . They had previously lost four in a row and seven of their last ten , so this was a huge sigh of relief for the Heat . Conversely , it was very tough loss for the Hornets , who also remain in reach of that final playoff spot . The loss brings them to two games back from the Celtics , so they 're officially in desperation mode for their final five outings . The Heat were the superior shooters in this game , going 49 percent from the field , while the Hornets finished at 43 percent . They were led by point guard Goran Dragic , who scored a team - high of 28 points ( 10 - 16 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 8 - 8 FT ) , to go along with five assists and two steals . His shot looks to be dialed in at the moment , as he 's combined to shoot an impressive 16 - for - 26 from the field to score 43 points over his last two games . Luol Deng also played a big factor in the win . He posted 21 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and six rebounds , while playing 41 minutes . After recording just three points on 1 - of - 8 shooting from the field in Sunday 's game against the Pacers , he got back on track with this line , and the Heat will need him to continue to stay hot if they want to push themselves into the playoffs . Dwyane Wade had a strong showing as well with 19 points ( 6 - 17 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 7 - 10 FT ) and five assists . He did have a season - high of seven turnovers though , so it was n't all good for the guard . It was Gerald Henderson that kept the Hornets close though . Henderson went 11 - for - 18 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 29 points before fouling out . It was his second highest points total of the season , as he was able to shoot higher than 60 percent from the floor . Kemba Walker had decent showing as well . In 39 minutes , he finished with 17 points ( 7 - 20 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 3 - 5 FT ) , four assists and three steals . He 's now combined for 41 points and six assists over his last two games , but he 'll need to do even more if the Hornets want any chance at sneaking into the playoffs . Recording a double - double , Bismack Biyombo chipped in with 12 points ( 4 - 6 FG , 4 - 6 FT ) , 12 rebounds and four blocked shots . Getting the start and extended playing time with both Al Jefferson and Cody Zeller sidelined , Biyombo was able to record one of his better statistical outings of the season . Mo Williams added 15 points ( 5 - 17 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) and four assists off the bench . The Heat 's next game will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Thursday , while the Hornets will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday .
Things looked to finally be turning around for Klay Thompson , who got off to an incredibly rough start to the regular season . However , after four straight games where he shot over 50 percent from the field , he posted another clunker of a game on Wednesday night , shooting just 5 - of - 14 from the field en route to an underwhelming 15 points . Most striking , though , might have been his 3 - of - 11 performance from long range and his performances from behind the arc all season . Through his five - year NBA career , Klay has not made less than 40 percent of his 3 - point attempts . Through 11 games this season , Klay is shooting just 32 percent from behind the arc , and while the Warriors are surviving despite the sharpshooter fighting inconsistencies and failing to live up to standards , they 'll want their shooting guard playing his best when it really matters .
The Toronto Raptors defeated the host New Orleans Pelicans , 94 - 87 , at Smoothie King Center on Wednesday . Despite there being just four ties and 11 lead changes in this game , it was close throughout . In fact , neither team led by more than 10 points , as it came down to the final seconds . Three-point shooting was the only real difference , as New Orleans went just 9 - of - 29 , while Toronto went 8 - of - 21 . The statistics were unbelievably close , as rebounding , assists , steals , blocks and turnovers were all within two of one another . The Raptors ( 38 - 26 ) are 5 - 2 since the All-Star break , as they continue to patch things together without Kyle Lowry . Jonas Valanciunas was the star , as he accrued 25 points and 13 rebounds to lead Toronto . DeMar DeRozan finished second on the team , collecting 14 points and six assists . Serge Ibaka totaled 12 points , five rebounds , two steals and four blocks . On deck for Toronto is a road matchup with the Atlanta Hawks on Friday . The Pelicans ( 25 - 40 ) are now just 1 - 6 in games with DeMarcus Cousins , as they simply ca n't find any rhythm . Cousins did lead the team in scoring , though , tallying 25 points , 10 rebounds , three assists and two blocks . Anthony Davis totaled just seven points and four rebounds , as he left after 17 minutes with a wrist injury . Jordan Crawford played well off the bench in his second game with New Orleans , as he provided 10 points , three rebounds and three assists . New Orleans will play the Charlotte Hornets for their next game on Saturday .
The Sacramento Kings ( 21 - 37 ) defeated the New York Knicks ( 12 - 47 ) 124 - 86 on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden in New York . The Kings dominated this game offensively right from the beginning , out - scoring the Knicks 65 - 39 by half , and reaching the 100 - point mark after just the third quarter . Their superior shooting was a big reason for this , as they went 49 percent from the field and 56 percent from the three - point line , while the Knicks finished at 37 percent from the floor and just 18 percent from deep . Along with that , the Kings also secured a 46 - 38 rebounding advantage , only furthering their impressive performance Tuesday .

Rudy Gay led the way , going 9 - for - 15 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 25 points , to go along with seven rebounds and four assists in just 26 minutes . He 's now shot 40 percent or higher in each of his last four games , a span where he 's averaging 23 points and 7 rebounds . DeMarcus Cousins also was a big factor in the win , finishing with 22 points ( 5 - 10 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 11 - 11 FT ) , 10 rebounds and two blocked shots . Like Gay , he 's been a beast lately , averaging 24 points and 11 rebounds over his last five games . Both players could have put up some even higher numbers in this matchup , but because of the blowout , they were each held to less than 30 minutes on the court . Ben McLemore was also very efficient with his time , scoring 20 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) in just 23 minutes . He 's picked up his game of late , recording two 20 - point games over his last three , despite averaging just 12 points on the season . Coming off the bench , Derrick Williams and Nik Stauskas reached double figures as well with 17 and 15 points respectively .

Alexey Shved led the team in scoring , posting 15 points ( 4 - 11 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 7 - 9 FT ) , to go along with seven rebounds and three assists in 32 minutes . It was a season - high in minutes for the guard , as he took advantage of the extra time with his second 15 - point showing in a row . Shane Larkin was also one of those bench players who provided some points . He went 5 - for - 9 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from the three - point line to finish with 13 points , while adding six assists and two steals as well . It was just the sixth time all season that he finished in double - digit points . The only other Knick to reach double figures was Jason Smith , who posted 13 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) , four rebounds and three blocked shots in 21 minutes . The Kings ' next game will be on the road against the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday , while the Knicks will travel to Indiana to play the Pacers on Wednesday .
The Dallas Mavericks ( 5 - 4 ) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers ( 1 - 8 ) 90 - 82 on Friday . Kobe Bryant had missed the last two games with a back injury and had originally been reported to be out of Friday 's contest as well . However , Bryant was healthy enough to take the floor after all , and posted his second - best scoring total of the season with 19 points on a season best 47 percent shooting . Bryant 's return sent Metta World Peace back to the bench , where he failed to score over 17 minutes of action . The Lakers also received a team - best 21 points from Jordan Clarkson , which served as the young guard 's best game since his season - high 30 - point outburst versus the Nuggets on Nov. 3 . Rookie D'Angelo Russell tallied only nine points over 24 minutes , marking the third time in four games that he 's failed to score in double digits . Interestingly , Los Angeles lost despite outrebounding the Mavericks 57 to 48 , led by Roy Hibbert and Julius Randle 's nine and 10 boards , respectively . Besides Bryant and Clarkson , backup guard Louis Williams was the only other Laker to hit double - digit points ( 10 ) . The Lakers fell to 1 - 8 and remain in last place in the Western Conference’s Pacific Division . They head home for a Sunday tilt versus the Pistons . The Mavericks benefited from an impressive double - double from offseason acquisition Zaza Pachulia , who posted 18 points and 16 rebounds . It was another forgettable performance for the Lakers ' frontcourt , who came into Friday night 's contest ranked last in scoring surrendered to opposing centers at an average of 25 points per game . Deron Williams supplemented Pachulia 's contributions with 13 points , seven rebounds , and three steals , while Dwight Powell pitched in with another highly efficient performance off the bench . Powell tallied 10 points , 12 rebounds , two assists , and a steal in just 22 minutes , and was the only other Dallas player with double - digit points .

Their shooting percentage was a big reason for that , as they went 47 percent from the field , while the Nuggets finished at just 33 percent . The Nets also out - rebounded the Nuggets 57 - 49 , even furthering their advantage and helping them secure an impressive 28 - point victory on the road .

With Wilson Chandler sitting out , Darrell Arthur moved into the starting lineup and posted 10 points ( 5 - 15 FG ) and seven rebounds . It was only his second start of the year , so it was good to see him have some success . Rookie Gary Harris was the only other Nugget in double figures , as he finished with 10 points ( 4 - 12 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 1 - 3 FT ) of his own . The Nets ' next game will be on the road against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday , while the Nuggets will be at home against the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday .

The Latvian came off the bench to score 15 points in 29 minutes , but it was Carmelo Anthony that really kept the team in the team . Anthony finished with a game - high 34 points on 13 - of - 27 shooting on top of 10 rebounds , while Derrick Rose had his second straight solid game , as he finished with 20 points . In the end , however , it was New York 's inability to hit an outside shot that ultimately led to their demise , as they made just seven of their 24 attempts from long range ( 29 percent ) . Up next , the Wizards will look for their fifth straight win against the Pistons on Saturday , while the Knicks will remain home Saturday to take on the Suns .
The Sacramento Kings ( 19 - 23 ) defeated the Atlanta Hawks ( 26 - 18 ) 91 - 88 on Thursday night . Both teams came into this game in the midst of three - game winning streaks and both teams came in on the back end of a back - to - back set . It was clear there were some tired legs out there , as the shooting was off with a much lower score than anticipated . Both squads combined to shoot well under 40 percent from the field with the two teams combining to go 15 - for - 57 from three - point range while committing 19 turnovers each . What ultimately got Sacramento their win was an 180 run in the third quarter in which the Hawks went nearly six minutes without scoring . Atlanta was able to fight back and get it to a tied ball game , but still couldn’t prevail late . Another huge key was the rebounding , as the Kings snatched down 56 boards to the Hawks 42 . This snapped a 15 - game winning streak for Atlanta over Sacramento , which was one of the longest current streaks in the NBA . Atlanta has been struggling with their frontcourt defense all season and that became another huge issue tonight . It 's one thing to allow DeMarcus Cousins to have a monster game , but allowing a rookie like Willie Cauley-Stein to record a double - double as well is unacceptable . No Hawks player had a great game tonight aside from Paul Millsap , who tallied 14 points , 14 rebounds , three assists , five steals and four blocks in another spectacular all - around game . Millsap looks poised to make the All-Star team this year ad it 's because of his ability to stuff the stat sheet like he did tonight . Jeff Teague has had a down year by his standards and he struggled yet again here , as he shot 2 - for - 8 while amassing just four points and four assists in the loss . In fact , he was benched for long stretches of this game , including the majority of the fourth quarter . Atlanta gets a much needed day off on Friday and then they get a good matchup against the Phoenix Suns on Saturday in their next game . Sacramento has quietly been one of the best teams in the west over the last two months and wins like this show why . They now have wins over the Hawks , Los Angeles Clippers and Oklahoma City Thunder over their last three weeks and that 's indicative of how much they have improved over recent weeks . DeMarcus Cousins has been the best player in the world in that stretch and he continued it here , by recording 24 points , 15 rebounds , five assists and three steals in the win . All five starters scored in double - figures and that 's a great sign with Rudy Gay sitting out this game with a heel injury . Rajon Rondo didn’t shoot well , but he did accumulate 11 points , 10 rebounds and 11 assists in yet another triple - doubling performance . Sacramento will look to extend their winning streak to five games on Saturday against the Indiana Pacers .
The Brooklyn Nets ( 5 - 13 ) defeated the Phoenix Suns ( 8 - 10 ) 94 - 91 on Tuesday . Brook Lopez has been the one dependable source of offense for the Nets in a dismal first quarter of the 2015 - 16 campaign . Brooklyn 's big man has tallied double - digit points in every game , and was the top scoring center in the league entering Tuesday 's contest ( 20 points per game ) . Lopez spearheaded the offensive cause once again versus the Suns , collecting 23 points and adding six rebounds , two assists and a block . Even on a night where frontcourt partner - in - crime Thaddeus Young had a down game by his standards , Lopez demonstrated the ability to once again put the offense on his shoulders and carry the Nets to a second consecutive victory . The visiting Suns enjoyed solid performances from three of their starters , but saw a couple of their more talented scorers trudge through poor performances . Brandon Knight scored a game - high 26 points , and added seven rebounds and four assists . It marked the Phoenix point guard 's third game in the last four where he 's totaled 21 points or more . Backcourt mate Eric Bledsoe had a quiet first half , but came on in the third and fourth quarters to finish with 17 points , seven assists , a a pair of rebounds and four steals . Meanwhile , Alex Len turned in an outstanding performance while making his second start in place of Tyson Chandler ( hamstring ) , posting a 13 - point , 14 - rebound double - double , and filling out the stat sheet with a pair of assists , a pair of steals and three blocks . However , starting power forward Markieff Morris and high - usage reserve T.J. Warren could only muster six - point performances each , leaving a sizable void in the Suns ' offensive effort . Mirza Teletovic did post another strong outing to lead the Suns ' bench , collecting 12 points and five rebounds in his third consecutive game with double - digit points . The Suns fell to 8 - 10 and currently reside in third place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They head to Detroit to face the Pistons on Wednesday . Jarrett Jack supported Lopez as the only other double - digit scorer in Brooklyn 's starting five , stuffing the stat sheet with 11 points , eight assists , four rebounds and three steals . The last swipe was the most timely of the three , as Jack was able to take the ball from Knight as time expired to prevent the Suns ' point guard from attempting a game - tying three - point shot . Young pitched in eight points , four rebounds and a pair of assists for only his second single - digit scoring night of the entire season . Impressive rookie Rondae Hollis-Jefferson ( eight points ) and veteran Joe Johnson ( nine points ) made modest contributions , although the former did add nine rebounds . Shane Larkin and Wayne Ellington paced the Brooklyn bench with a pair of 11 - point efforts , and made key contributions in the victory by scoring six and seven , respectively , in the final period . The Nets improved to 5 - 13 and currently reside in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They 've now won four straight home games and make the short trip to face the Knicks on Friday .

The six - year pro 's outstanding defense and improved shooting have certainly been key to many a Celtics victory this season , and Bradley put together a solid effort in his return . The 25 - year - old managed 14 points , two rebounds and two steals over a robust 38 minutes , but notably came up empty with respect to his trademark three - pointers . His third and final missed attempt of the night from beyond the arc was the most crucial , as Bradley failed to drain a 26 - foot three - point jumper at the buzzer that would have sent the contest into overtime . Isaiah Thomas almost single - handedly was too much for the Grizzlies , as he posted a game - high 35 points , three rebounds , eight assists and a steal .

Green returned to his stat stuffing ways and scored 16 points , 11 rebounds , seven assists and four steals , while causing nightmares in transition for Cleveland . Curry and Thompson both added two dagger three - pointers down the stretch , but combined for a rare 20 points 8 - of - 27 shooting . Harrison Barnes got working early on in the first quarter and was part of the reason his team was able to get off to a quick lead in the first half , as he finished with 13 points on 6 - of - 10 shooting . The Warriors will host Game 2 on Sunday .
The Toronto Raptors ( 19 - 12 ) beat the Milwaukee Bucks ( 12 - 19 ) 111 - 90 on Saturday . Toronto earned a much - needed win in Milwaukee , as they managed to dominate on both sides of the ball . Headed into the matchup , the Raptors had lost three of their previous five matchups . Center Bismack Biyombo helped lead the comeback win , offering up 14 points , 12 rebounds , and four blocks on the night . Biyombo has been a force while filling in for injured starter Jonas Valancianus . The double - double comes as a follow - up to a dominant 20 - rebound performance . For the Bucks , defense appeared to be the main issue , as their opponents were able to knock down a highly efficient 52 percent of their shots . Shooting woes , too , contributed to the loss , as the Bucks shot just 42 percent from the field . Starters Michael Carter-Williams and Jabari Parker combined for an abysmal 6 - of - 25 shooting performance . Guard Khris Middleton , however , was able to get it going , hitting five three - pointers and posting 20 points . The Raptors are jocking for position near the top of the Eastern Conference . Their next contest will be on Monday in Chicago . The Bucks , meanwhile , will travel to Dallas for their next contest , also taking place on Monday .

Domantas Sabonis started off the game blazing , with nine points in the first quarter but did not score for the remainder of the game . Enes Kanter continued his strong play with 14 points and six rebounds , in 21 minutes off the bench . The Thunder now have a day off before they face off against the Bulls in Chicago on Monday . The Nuggets ( 14 - 23 ) kept things competitive in the first half , but could not keep up the pace beyond that , as the game progressively slipped away throughout the second half . Wilson Chandler was the high - point man for Denver , with 24 on 10 - of - 18 shooting , and added seven rebounds , two assists and two blocks , in 32 minutes off the bench . Five other players scored in double digits for the Nuggets , including Will Barton , who finished with 21 points . Barton started in place of Gary Harris ( groin ) , who was a late scratch . Nikola Jokic also sat this one out , as he was held up by an illness .

The Charlotte Hornets ( 7 - 6 ) handled the Philadelphia 76ers ( 0 - 13 ) 113 - 88 on Friday . These were two teams going in opposite directions coming into Friday 's game and that fact ended up playing out on the court yet again . It was a 21 - point game at the half and the Sixers couldn’t really recover after that poor start . The biggest discrepancies in the game were the free - throw shooting and turnovers . Charlotte made 21 - of - 22 free - throws while the Sixers went just 16 - for - 22 and the Hornets won the turnover battle 17 - 11 . It was already ugly for the Sixers , but it 's getting down right atrocious at this point . What 's really hurting this team is their offense , as they rank dead - last in the NBA in scoring and lowered that average here . Philadelphia opted to go with a smaller lineup by bringing Nerlens Noel off the bench , which is a strange move considering he 's arguably their best player . He still played 27 minutes and tallied 16 points and nine rebounds in the loss . The best player for the Sixers on this night was Nik Stauskas , who totaled 15 points , three assists and two rebounds in the defeat . Philadelphia will look to grab that first elusive win in Miami on Saturday against the Heat . The Hornets are quietly one of the hottest teams in the NBA right now , as they have won seven of their last 10 games . Much of that success can be credited to Nicolas Batum , but it was the mainstay combo of Kemba Walker and Al Jefferson who got it done on Friday night . Walker tallied 20 points and seven assists while Jefferson collected 26 points , 10 rebounds and five blocks in the win . Rookie Frank Kaminsky also had his best game in his short career , contributing nine points , three rebounds and three assists in the victory . This is a dangerous team in the East going forward and they look like a threat to make the playoffs and possibly win a game in the postseason for the first time in 14 years . They 'll look to keep up this form against the Sacramento Kings on Monday .
The Boston Celtics ( 13 - 23 ) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans ( 18 - 19 ) 108 - 100 on Monday at the TD Garden in Boston . After coming out of the third quarter down 76 - 72 , the Celtics did n't look to be in the best of positions . With a huge fourth quarter though , where the Celtics out - scored the Pelicans 36 - 24 , they were able to secure the eight point victory at home in front of their home crowd . The Celtics forced the Pelicans into 18 turnovers , while committing only 11 of their own , which may have been the difference in this game . The Celtics received most of their production from their forward position , as Jae Crowder and Jared Sullinger both had strong performances . Sullinger led the team , scoring 27 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 8 - 9 FT ) and grabbing 10 rebounds in 32 minutes . The 27 points were a season - high for him , while it marked his second double - double in as many games . Crowder on the other hand posted 22 points ( 9 - 14 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) , three assists , four steals and two blocks . While the 22 points were a season - high for him , so were the blocks and steals , as he was a huge contributor on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball Monday . The Celtics did receive plenty of help from their bench as well . Marcus Thornton had 13 points ( 2 - 8 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 8 - 9 FT ) in only 14 minutes , while Brandon Bass had 12 points ( 4 - 10 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) in 23 minutes . Both Avery Bradley and Evan Turner also reached double figures with 10 points apiece . Despite the loss , the Pelicans received another huge performance from Anthony Davis . Davis went 10 - for - 23 from the floor to score 34 points , while also adding nine rebounds and three blocked shots . He was able to get to the line at will in this game , converting on 14 - of - 15 free throws . He 's had the hot hand lately , averaging 29 points and 10 rebounds per game over his last three outings . Eric Gordon had arguably his best game of the season , going 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 21 points . It was a season - high in points for him , as he 's dealt with injuries for a large portion of the year . Coming off the bench with Gordon back in the starting lineup , Tyreke Evans still had a strong showing . He chipped in with 19 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) and eight rebounds , playing just under 35 minutes because Jrue Holiday was forced from the game after only 15 minutes with a right ankle injury . The Celtics ' next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday , while the Pelicans will be on the road against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday .
The host Memphis Grizzlies took down the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves , 102 - 98 , in their season opener Wednesday . Minnesota quickly jumped out to a 20 - 3 lead to begin the game , leaving Memphis in a tight spot almost immediately . The Grizzlies answered with a lightning - fast run of their own , however , and managed to exit the first quarter trailing by only three points . While reigning Rookie of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns scored nine points in the first five minutes of the contest , the Grizzlies were able to keep him relatively quiet during the second and third quarters . Towns still finished with a respectable 21 points . Veteran center Marc Gasol , who Towns has called his toughest matchup , made this no easy feat , however , recording four blocks to go along with 18 points . Two other members of Memphis 's longstanding core , Mike Conley and Zach Randolph , also contributed heavily in the points column , scoring 24 and 19 respectively . While Memphis 's veterans drove the win , Minnesota saw major contributions from their younger players . Third-year wing Andrew Wiggins led the team in scoring , posting 25 points , while high - flying young guard Zach LaVine dropped in 19 . Towns , meanwhile , added five assists and four rebounds to complement his scoring output . The contest was also the NBA debut for rookie Kris Dunn , the fifth overall pick in the 2016 draft . Dunn played behind LaVine and Ricky Rubio , clocking just 15 minutes of game time . He contributed eight points and four rebounds during that time on the floor . The Wolves will visit Sacramento on Saturday , while Memphis will take to the road to face the Knicks .
The Miami Heat defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves , 115 - 113 , at Target Center on Monday . Late in the contest , with 17 seconds left , the Heat ( 22 - 30 ) held an eight - point lead and were seemingly well on their way to their 11th straight victory . But then , a couple of Miami turnovers and a few big plays from Andrew Wiggins later , the Timberwolves ( 19 - 33 ) had one last chance to either tie or take the lead with eight seconds remaining in the game . However , Wiggins ' fallaway mid - range jumper would not go down and the time would expire , and the Heat 's miraculous win streak remained alive . In the end , it was the Goran Dragic show in Minneapolis , with the point guard hitting nearly everything he threw up and finishing with a team - high 33 points on 13 - of - 17 shooting from the field and 7 - of - 9 shooting from behind the arc on top of nine assists . And that hot shooting was contagious , as the rest of the Miami players launched from three - point land with plenty of confidence and the team shot an astounding 54 percent from long range , solidifying them as one of the hottest teams in basketball . As for Minnesota , they got impressive performances out of their two stars in Karl-Anthony Towns and Wiggins , but they were unable to walk away with the victory in their second game without Zach LaVine , who is out for the season with a torn ACL . Towns finished with a game - high 35 points and eight rebounds , while Wiggins ' late - game heroics and a 21 - point second half led to him finishing with 27 points on 11 - of - 23 shooting from the field . Ricky Rubio also had yet another double - double , scoring 14 rebounds and dishing out 13 assists . Overall , it was an efficient game for the Timberwolves , who shot 54 percent from the field , but it ended up just being too little too late . Up next , the Heat will look to make it 12 straight wins Wednesday against the Bucks , while the Timberwolves will look to avoid their fifth straight loss Wednesday against the Raptors .
The Detroit Pistons ( 30 ) defeated the Chicago Bulls ( 2 - 1 ) 98 - 94 in overtime Friday . Both teams saw several established starters struggle mightily with their shots , and relied heavily on a narrow core of their starters for the bulk of the scoring as a result . The Bulls’ Derrick Rose was actually held scoreless until the fourth quarter , and finished with only eight points . The Pistons’ Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was similarly frustrated on offense , totaling only six points on 2 - for - 12 shooting . The Bulls were the beneficiaries of a third straight strong performance from power forward Nikola Mirotic , who tallied 22 points , including another three buckets from beyond the arc . Jimmy Butler paced the Bulls with a double - double that featured 23 points and 11 boards . Pau Gasol was the other main contributor on the night , posting a double - double of his own with 16 points and 12 rebounds .

It was business as usual for point guard Russell Westbrook as the Thunder earned their sixth win in seven games this season .

Westbrook turned it on in particular during the third quarter , in which he scored or assisted on all 20 points during a 200 Thunder run . A more efficient double - double came off the bench , with center Enes Kanter scoring a team - high 24 points on 10 - of - 12 shooting to go with 10 rebounds . Kanter played only 21 minutes but still made a significant impact in the scoring column .

The loss also ended Toronto 's four game winning streak . Both teams were missing their starting centers as Jonas Valanciunas ( hand ) and Tyson Chandler ( knee ) were both out . The Suns led 81 - 72 heading into the fourth but a late surge from Toronto brought them within buzzer - beater range , although this night , the second of a back - to - back , they could not get it done . DeMar DeRozan had a great game for the Raptors , scoring a season high 29 points on 11 - 20 shooting , along with seven assists and three rebounds in 37 minutes . Kyle Lowry continued his strong play as well , with 17 points , eight rebounds and five assists . DeMarre Carroll posted 20 points on 8 - 13 shooting , seven rebounds , three assists and two steals .

Phoenix had three bench players score 15 or more points ; quite the contrary to Torontos who had no bench players score in double digits . Mirza Teletovic was raining threes , shooting 6 - 7 from deep and finishing with 20 points , two rebounds and one assist , in only 18 minutes off the bench . T.J. Warren posted a double double with 15 points and 11 rebounds on 7 - 13 shooting , in 29 minutes off the bench .

The superstar big man finished with 21 points and 14 in just 29 minutes , which was his seventh double - double in his last eight games . But what really carried New Orleans through the final stretch of the game was their bench , as Langston Galloway and Tyreke Evans each scored 18 points as reserves , with the bench as a whole scoring 54 of the team 's 118 points Wednesday . On top of all that , the Pelicans managed to shoot an impressive 42 percent from behind the arc . As for the Magic ( 17 - 27 ) , they have now lost three in a row and seven of their last eight games following Wednesday 's performance . While four of their five starters managed to score in double figures , no one was able to a put together a standout performance on a forgettable night for the team . Their main issue ended up being their inability to take care of the basketball , as they had just 18 assists to their 18 turnovers . They also ended up shooting a poor 44 percent from the field and shot just 11 free throws throughout the 48 minutes . Up next , the Pelicans will remain home Friday when they take on the Nets , while the Magic will look to turn things around Friday against the Bucks .
The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks , 113 - 102 , at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday . The two teams met for the second straight night after going into overtime yesterday , but LeBron James and Kyrie Irving showed little sign of fatigue . With Kevin Love out once again with a knee injury , the Big Two stepped up in his stead , tallying 29 and 31 points , respectively . Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker did a pretty good job going blow for blow with the All-Star duo , but received precious little support from anyone else on the Bucks ( 13 - 14 ) . Meanwhile , the Cavs ( 21 - 6 ) were just a bit better with their shot , as they managed success rates of 49 and 56 percent , respectively , from the field and three - point range . Antetokounmpo led the way for Milwaukee with 28 points , five rebounds , five assists , two steals and a block . Parker was right behind him with 27 points , two assists , a rebound and a block . However , John Henson ( four points , eight rebounds , an assist and two blocks ) , Tony Snell ( three points , one rebound , one assist ) and Matthew Dellavedova ( two points , three assists , two rebounds , two steals ) significantly underwhelmed on the offensive end . In fact , the only other double - digit scorer for the vistors came from the bench , as rookie Malcolm Brogdon went for 11 points , seven assists , five rebounds and three steals . Irving added a career - high 13 assists , six rebounds and a steal to his game - high scoring total . James complemented his points with nine rebounds and six assists . Richard Jefferson drew another start in Love 's place and supplied 10 points , four assists and a block . Tristan Thompson turned in just five points but hauled in 15 rebounds .

The Denver Nuggets ( 28 - 38 ) defeated the Washington Wizards ( 30 - 35 ) 116 - 100 on Saturday . The recent forms of these teams would have indicated this result , but it happened in a strange fashion . Denver went on a 19 - 3 run in the fourth quarter to make a big comeback and run away with the win . In fact , the Nuggets outscored the Wizards 41 to 17 in the fourth quarter . What was most impressive is that the Denver reserves played the entirety of the fourth quarter and led the comeback . The Nuggets shot 53 percent from the field , while holding the Wizards to just 42 percent shooting . The Denver bench also outscored the Washington bench 75 to 34 . Washington had to play this game in the second half of a back - to - back set and it was clear they couldn’t keep up in the altitude . The Wizards had a seven - minute stretch in the fourth quarter where they failed to make a basket . John Wall shot poorly , but still finished with 19 points and 11 assists in the loss . Otto Porter played well , as he scored 23 points and recorded five steals . On deck for Washington is a matchup against the Detroit Pistons on Monday .

Augustin and Will Barton both double - doubled off the bench as well , as they scored 31 combined points . The Nuggets will look to keep up the winning streak against the Miami Heat on Monday .
The host Atlanta Hawks defeated the Milwaukee Bucks , 107 - 100 , at Philips Arena on Wednesday . Most of the statistics would indicate a Milwaukee win , but Atlanta prevailed thanks to great teamwork . The second quarter was especially decisive , as the Hawks outscored the Bucks 31 - 9 in that 12 - minute stretch . Strangely , Milwaukee took 26 more shots than Atlanta , but made only four more baskets . The Bucks also dominated in the paint , outscoring the Hawks 50 - 28 . Atlanta was extremely efficient though , as they shot 49 percent from the field and assisted on 29 of their 35 made baskets . They also took care of business at the charity stripe , going 27 - of - 31 from the free - throw line . Milwaukee ( 5 - 5 ) had their opportunities to win this game , but they realized how tough it is to beat an efficient Atlanta team . Giannis Antetokounmpo carried the load , as he tallied 26 points , 15 rebounds and seven assists . Jabari Parker was great as well , totaling 23 points , eight rebounds , three assists and three steals of his own . The only other starter in double figures was Tony Snell , who amassed 11 points , four rebounds and three assists . Mirza Teletovic was a nice spark off the bench , as he scored 14 points on 5 - of - 10 shooting . Milwaukee will be on back - to - back duties , as they travel to face the Miami Heat on Thursday for their next game . Atlanta ( 9 - 2 ) had to play this game without Dwight Howard ( quad ) , but they did n't miss a beat . Paul Millsap stepped up in his absence , as he tallied 21 points , eight rebounds and three assists in the win . Mike Muscala started for Howard and provided 16 points , five rebounds and three assists of his own . Kyle Korver had one of his best games of the season , totaling 11 points , six rebounds and five assists .

The Chicago Bulls ( 42 - 40 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 10 - 72 ) in the season finale Wednesday night at United Center , 115 - 105 . Philadelphia exploded out of the gate , scoring 32 points in the first quarter and 60 poitns in the first half , enough to take a nine - point lead into the break . But the 76ers offense completely collapsed in the third quarter , as Philadelphia notched just 13 points in the frame and saw their nine - point lead turn into a 13 - point deficit , a big enough swing for the Bulls to coast to the finish line . The three - pointers were flying all day in this one , as the two teams combined to make 32 of their 59 attempts , a ridiculous 54 shooting percentage from downtown for the two squads . Nikola Mirotic knocked down seven three - pointers en route to a 32 - point night to lead all scorers . Jrue Holiday hit five threes of his own and finished with 29 points , and Jimmy Butler notched a triple - double with 10 points , 12 rebounds , and 10 assists . Chicago shot just 42 percent from inside the arc but made 15 of their 24 three - pionters ( 63 percent ) , a relentless barrage that inevitably sunk the 76ers . Robert Covington led the 76ers with six three - poinit makes and 27 points . Jerian Grant finished with 20 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 2 - 4 3PT , 4 - 6 FT ) and Hollis Thompson came off the bench to add 21 points ( 8 - 13 FG , 3 - 6 3PT , 2 - 3 FT ) .

Both clubs have been eliminated from postseason contention .
The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves , 112 - 100 , at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday . In the extended absence of Victor Oladipo ( wrist ) , the Thunder ( 19 - 12 ) have naturally depended heavily on perennial All-Star Russell Westbrook , and he 's validated their faith on countless occasions . However , others in the OKC supporting cast have occasionally stepped up to lessen the load on the dynamic point guard , and such was the case on Christmas Day . It was the Thunder 's pair of big men , Steven Adams and Enes Kanter , who turned in 22 and 20 points , respectively , to supplement a game - high 31 points from Westbrook , who also provided 15 assists , seven rebounds , a steal and a block . That trio of efforts helped lead to a 51 percent success rate from the field for the Thunder , which helped offset their 15 turnovers . The Timberwolves ( 9 - 21 ) were led by Karl-Anthony Towns , who supplied 26 points and eight rebounds . Andrew Wiggins was right behind him with 23 points , three rebounds , two assists and two steals . Zach LaVine , coming off a 40 - point explosion against the Sacramento Kings on Friday night , was relatively quiet with 16 points , which he supplemented with two assists , a rebound and a steal . Ricky Rubio was only able to muster three points , but he did hand out 10 assists , haul in seven boards and record a pair of steals . Shabazz Muhammad paced the second unit with 15 points . Adams added six rebounds , an assist and two steals to his aforementioned scoring total . Kanter registered four rebounds , four assists and a steal in addition to his 20 points . The starting five outside of Westbrook and Adams provided precious little on the scoreboard , as Andre Roberson , Domantas Sabonis and Anthony Morrow combined for just nine points . Alex Abrines tallied 10 points over 21 minutes in a reserve role . The Timberwolves head back home to face the Atlanta Hawks on Monday night , while the Thunder head down to South Florida to tangle with the Miami Heat on Tuesday evening .
The Chicago Bulls ( 17 - 12 ) came up with a big 104 - 97 home win , over the Toronto Raptors ( 19 - 13 ) , Monday night . This was the two teams first match of the season .

They also had five players score in double digits , including three who scored at least 20 .

Derrick Rose was solid , finishing with 20 points ( 7 - 16 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , four assists , one rebound and one block , in 28 minutes . Aaron Brooks was a huge spark off the bench , scoring three and - one 's in the second quarter alone . He finished with 17 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 4 - 5 FT ) .

The Utah Jazz defeated the Phoenix Suns 112 - 105 at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Tuesday . The Jazz ( 14 - 9 ) claimed their third straight victory and have won seven of their last eight contests . Gordon Hayward added another 20 - plus point performance , contributing 28 points on 8 - of - 16 shooting . Rudy Gobert flashed another brilliant game on both ends of the floor , which has been a major reason for Utah 's winning ways of recent , as he scored 22 points , grabbed 11 rebounds and racked up four blocks in 38 minutes . The bench was led by Sheldon Mack , who scored 12 points and dished out four assists in 30 minutes of action . Devin Booker was the lone bright spot for the Suns in the loss , as he scored 21 points on 9 - of - 13 shooting . The resurgent , but streaky Booker , is still maturing in his young career , but when he is on he caused multiple mismatches for the Jazz . Three bench players found double figures for Phoenix , as Alex Len , Leandro Barbosa and Brandon Knight all amassed 20 - plus minutes and 10 - plus points . Next up , the Suns host the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday , while the Jazz host the Golden State Warriors .
The Los Angeles Clippers ( 22 - 13 ) throttled the Philadelphia 76ers ( 3 - 33 ) 130 - 99 on Saturday night to extend their season - long winning streak . This looked like a mismatch on paper and that proved to be the case on the court . The Clippers scored at least 27 points in every quarter and took a 29 - point lead into the fourth . They shot an incredible 61 percent from the field in the win and had far too many easy buckets . The starters were also a huge difference , as the Los Angeles starters amassed 72 points while the Sixers starters could only muster up 34 points . Philadelphia came into this game as huge underdogs in the second half of a back - to - back and it was clear they didn’t have it tonight . If that doesn’t make it hard enough , their 3 - 33 record does . They have been playing much more competitive lately , but this game was just one of those road blowouts that has become all too common with this team . Ish Smith led the team with 10 assists and Jahlil Okafor had a nice game off the bench . Okafor tallied 23 points and four rebounds in just 18 minutes of action . The Sixers will take on a fellow lottery contender on Monday when they play the Minnesota Timberwolves in their next game . The Clippers set a season - high tonight with their sixth - straight win and did it in dominating fashion . The starters were actually allowed to sit the final quarter and they could have had monster games if they got a full complement of minutes . Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan were still able to record double - doubles in just three quarters . Paul totaled 15 points and 14 assists , while Jordan provided 22 points and 13 rebounds . Austin Rivers scored a team - high 26 points , with most of that coming in garbage time It 's strange to see this team finally clicking after the injury to Blake Griffin , but they ca n't be any worse when he returns in a few weeks . The Clippers will have some time off until they play the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday in their next game .
The New York Knicks ( 25 - 35 ) defeated the Orlando Magic ( 25 - 32 ) 108 - 95 on Friday .

Quietly , Tobias Harris has continued to have one of the more productive seasons of his career , and he 's managed to do so despite taking on a role off the bench . In fact , Harris has managed to be much more productive off the bench this season compared to when he 's in the starting lineup . Wednesday 's performance was yet another example , as Harris shot an efficient 9 - of - 13 from the field en route to scoring 19 points to accompany his eight rebounds and four assists . In 11 games as a reserve , Harris is now averaging 19 points and 6 rebounds per game , compared to averaging 16 points and 6 rebounds per game as a starter . It should also be noted that despite having better production , Harris is playing two minutes less when he is coming off the bench .
The New York Knicks defeated the Chicago Bulls , 104 - 89 , at Madison Square Garden on Thursday . The Knicks ( 18 - 22 ) have n't exactly caught many breaks over the last two - plus weeks , having lost nine of their last 10 . They were on the right side of Lady Luck for a change Thursday , however , as the Bulls ( 19 - 21 ) were without Jimmy Butler and Nikola Mirotic due to illness . The Knicks were a bit on the short - handed side themselves , as Kristaps Porzingis sat out with a sore Achilles .

The Los Angeles Clippers ( 9 - 8 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 8 - 9 ) 107 - 99 on Sunday . The Clippers led by 11 at the half and it never got much closer than that .

Both teams shot well in this matchup , as Minnesota shot 45 percent while Los Angeles shot 52 percent . The Clippers starters outscored the Wolves starters 80 - 58 and that proved to be the difference in the game . Minnesota was 6 - 2 on the road coming into this game , but were unable to add to that impressive record . Minnesota had six players score in double - digits , but the problem was that the other five players combined for just eight points , with three of them going scoreless . The T-Wolves were led by Andrew Wiggins once again who dropped 21 points . Zach LaVine also had a nice game filling - in for Ricky Rubio , as he tallied 18 points and seven assists in the defeat . Karl-Anthony Towns was having a very good game through three quarters , but he barely played in the fourth for an unknown reason . Minnesota will take on the Orlando Magic in their next fixture on Tuesday . The Clippers had lost eight of 11 games before their win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday , so this added to that to start a modest two - game winning streak . Los Angeles got some much needed momentum here , as they are far too talented to be hovering around .500 . They were extremely efficient today as a team , as they shot 52 percent and assisted 24 times on 39 baskets . The team was led by a near triple - double from Blake Griffin , who collected 26 points , eight rebounds and eight assists in the win . They also got 20 points and nine assists from Chris Paul and these two will need to play like this going forward if they want to dig out of this hole . They 'll keep digging in a favorable matchup , when they host the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday .
The recent form of these teams would indicate a Miami blowout , but Orlando had other ideas . In fact , they led for well over 40 minutes of this game , as they never looked in jeopardy to relinquish the lead . Rebounding was the key , with the Magic winning that battle , 52 - 37 . Three-point shooting was a huge factor as well , with Orlando hitting 57 percent from long distance to Miami 's 27 percent .

Paul Millsap , Al Horford , Kyle Korver , and DeMarre Carroll were all rested for this game and Dennis Schroder started in place of Jeff Teague . The Hawks started Elton Brand , Mike Muscala , John Jenkins , and Kent Bazemore alongside Schroder . They showed good chemistry throughout the game with 32 assists on 37 field goals . Bazemore had a season - high 20 points and Muscala posted a double - double with 18 points and 10 rebounds . The Hawks will return to action Monday against the Bucks . Charlotte was n't necessarily at full strength Saturday , but was able to get an important win as it continues to make a push for a post season spot . Michael Kidd-Gilchrist ( ankle ) and Cody Zeller ( shoulder ) both missed this game , opening the opportunity for Jeff Taylor and Marvin Williams to move into the starting lineup . Al Jefferson had just two points in 17 minutes on the floor . The Hornets are now just a game out of the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference and will have a chance at another big win on Monday when they host the Celtics .
The San Antonio Spurs ( 47 - 26 ) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies ( 50 - 24 ) 103 - 89 Sunday at the AT & T Center in a clash of two of the best teams in the Western Conference San Antonio had the lead for the entirety of Sunday 's game , but Memphis hung close until the fourth quarter . Kawhi Leonard scored the Spurs ' first 15 points of the fourth to help break the game open . Leonard finished with a game - high 25 points and 10 rebounds in 33 minutes of action . While the Spurs are peaking at the right time of the season , the Grizzlies ' recent struggles are starting to become a concern . The Grizzlies have dropped three straight to top - level competition by an average margin of 20 points . Houston has now overtaken Memphis for the second seed in the West . Memphis 's fourth quarter implosion led to its third loss in a row . The Grizzlies have only had one other stretch with more consecutive losses , which was a four game skid back in December . Zach Randolph broke out his mini - slump Sunday , however , with 20 points and 13 boards in 33 minutes . The Grizzlies will look to bounce back Monday when they host the Kings . San Antonio is looking more and more like its championship team from a year ago . Sunday was another all - around effort from the Spurs , who had a plus - 14 rebounding margin and shot 50 percent from the floor as a team . Tony Parker had 17 points and six assists and Tiago Splitter was solid again with 15 points and eight rebounds . The Spurs will return to action Tuesday when they take on the Heat in Miami in a rematch of the last two finals .
The Indiana Pacers ( 38 - 43 ) kept their playoff hopes alive Tuesday with a 99 - 95 double - overtime victory over the the Washington Wizards ( 46 - 35 ) at Bankers Life Fieldhouse . The Pacers were in a must - win situation Tuesday after recent skids by the Heat and Nets vaulted them temporarily into the eighth seed in the East . Both teams got off to frigid starts on the offensive end , highlighted by an 0 - for - 9 stretch by the Pacers in the second quarter . Neither team reached the 50 - point mark until the 4:20 mark in the third quarter when John Wall found Marcin Gortat for an easy layup . The teams went back - and - forth throughout the fourth quarter , but a missed John Wall floater at the buzzer sent the game into overtime . One overtime was n't enough to decide the outcome , however , as the Pacers and Wizards mustered just four points apiece in the first extra period . Indiana 's George Hill clutch three - pointer in the second OT gave the Pacers a five point lead with under 30 seconds remaining to help seal the victory . The Pacers are in position to clinch the East 's final playoff spot with a win Wednesday against the Grizzlies or a Nets loss . Washington entered Tuesday with the fifth seed in hand , but decided to play its starters against a playoff caliber team . Nene Hill was sidelined with an ankle injury , which moved veteran Drew Gooden into the starting lineup . Five different Wizards logged over 40 minutes of playing time , led by Marcin Gortat and John Wall with 44 minutes . Wall finished with 16 points on 7 - of - 23 shooting and added 11 assists while Gortat posted 19 points and 10 rebounds . Washington will finish wrap up the regular season Wednesday in Cleveland . Indiana lost seven out of eight in late March to temporarily fall out of a playoff spot , but its current six - game win streak has given it control of its playoff destiny . George Hill finished just shy of a triple - double with 24 points , 10 assists , and nine rebounds . C.J Miles followed his 30 - point outing Sunday with a 25 point performance and he also grabbed eight rebounds . Paul George exceeded his minutes restriction , finishing with 10 points in 18 minutes on the floor . Indiana 's win eliminated Miami from playoff contention , but a matchup with Memphis on Wednesday will be no easy task for the Pacers just one night after a double - overtime victory .
The New Orleans Pelicans ( 15 - 14 ) defeated the San Antonio Spurs ( 18 - 13 ) 97 - 90 on Friday . New Orleans has won four of their last six . While they are currently fighting for one of the last playoff spots in the Western Conference , the Pelicans are still finding out how to win every night . They have the talent to beat the best teams in the West , but the Pelicans lack the experience and chemistry to play as consistently from game to game as the top eight teams in the conference . Anthony Davis and Ryan Anderson both put up a game - high 22 points . Davis also posted 12 rebounds and five blocks in 38 minutes , while Anderson also posted seven rebounds and two three - pointers in 33 minutes off the bench . New Orleans will have another tough matchup Saturday when they travel to Chicago to take on the Bulls . San Antonio has been trying to navigate one of the more treacherous parts of their schedule while resting players nightly to try and make sure they 're healthy when the real games begin in the playoffs . As a result , they 've lost six of their last seven games . Tony Parker returned for the last two games but did not play Friday , and it 's unlcear whether he was simply being rested on the second game of a back - to - back set or if he aggravated his hamstring injury . Cory Joseph earned the start in his place . Kawhi Leonard ( hand ) continues to sit out indefinitely , giving Kyle Anderson another spot start at small forward . After sitting out Thursday 's game with an illness , Boris Diaw was available to play Friday . He put up 10 points and six rebounds in 25 minutes off the bench . The Spurs gave up 20 easy points off of 17 turnovers , pointing to their greatest weakness Friday and the likely reason why they lost the game . San Antonio will host the Houston Rockets on Sunday .

The Houston Rockets ( 2 - 3 ) defeated the Orando Magic ( 1 - 4 ) by a score of 119 - 114 in overtime Wednesday at the Toyota Center . Evan Fournier hit a pair of free throws with a second remaining in regulation to force overtime , but the Magic only hit two shots in overtime en route to their fourth loss of the season . Corey Brewer missed two huge free throws late in the fourth quarter , but it did n't cost the Rockets , who have won two straight after starting the season 0 - 3 . James Harden scored six of his 28 points in free basketball to ice the win for Houston . The Magic are still a very young team , but are beginning to see what they have in Fournier and Aaron Gordon , who scored a season - high 19 points on 7 - of - 11 shooting to go along with eight rebounds . Fournier came a basket shy of posting back - to - back 30 - point outings .

While Harden led the Rockets in scoring for a second straight game , Dwight Howard was key in the victory , collecting 14 rebounds and adding 23 points in 31 minutes . Houston 's bench was unable to contribute much , forcing the starters to play big minutes and pick up more responsibility on offense . Harden reverted back to shooting poorly from the field ( 6 - for - 22 ) , but was able to get to the line 17 times , converting on 14 tries . Marcus Thornton provided a nice scoring spark again , finishing with 18 points and a pair of three - point field goals .

The New York Knicks defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves , 118 - 114 , at Madison Square Garden on Friday . Carmelo Anthony has begun to cede some of the offensive responsibility to sophomore sensation Kristaps Porzingis in some games due to the latter 's emergence , and such was the case when these two teams met just two nights prior . However , the perennial All-Star took back the mantle Friday , leading the way with 29 points , five rebounds , three assists and three steals . He also drained two key free throws with six seconds left , giving the Knicks ( 10 - 9 ) their final two points of the night and effectively sealing the win . His stellar performance led the way on a night when the entire New York starting five managed to hit double digits in the scoring column , and that also saw New York shoot 48 percent from the field overall . The Timberwolves ( 5 - 14 ) were paced by a 23 - point output from Zach LaVine , who complemented the scoring with three assists , two rebounds and a steal . Karl Anthony-Towns totaled 20 points , eight boards , an assist and a trio of blocks . Andrew Wiggins contributed 19 points , four assists , three rebounds and a steal .

The Golden State Warriors defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 115 - 98 at Staples Center on Wednesday . The rivalry match went in favor of the Warriors ( 19 - 3 ) , even though Stephen Curry struggled on the floor of Staples Center again this season . Regardless which Los Angeles team gets put on the court , Curry is a surprising 4 - of - 28 across three contests this season . Kevin Durant also had one of his worst games in a Warriors jersey , but the team effort led by Klay Thompson 's 24 points and the Clippers 40 percent shooting from the field was more than enough to hold a 20 point lead throughout most of the game . After a Draymond Green three - pointer and a Curry and - 1 layup with 2:10 left in the first quarter , Golden State went up by 15 points and did not have to look back . The closest the Clippers ( 16 - 7 ) came was seven points following a Chris Paul jumper midway through the third quarter , which cut the lead to seven points , but Green , Durant and Curry ripped off a quick scoring run to put the game out of reach . Thompson finished with 24 points , four rebounds and three assists , Curry scored 19 points but failed to make a three - pointer on eight attempts and Durant went 5 - of - 17 from the field on his way to 16 points , eight rebounds and seven assists . Green had the best all around performance after scoring 22 points and grabbing five rebounds , in addition to four assists and two steals on 8 - of - 10 shooting . Jamal Crawford provided 21 points off the bench to lead all Clippers scorers , but Chris Paul , DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin combined for just 37 points on 41 shots from the field . The weak showing from the Los Angeles starters sank their hopes of pulling out a win against their rivals , and have now dropped five of their last seven games . Next up , the Warriors play the second game of a back - to - back when they visit the Utah Jazz on Thursday , while the Clippers host the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday .
The Golden State Warriors defeated the Brooklyn Nets , 112 - 95 , at Oracle Arena on Saturday . Golden State was expected to win this game easily with a 22 - point spread and they took care of business . A 100 run to end the second quarter was a huge stretch , as it gave the Warriors an 11 - point lead , which they never relinquished from there . It was a near wire - to - wire win , as Brooklyn 's only lead was a one - point advantage for less than a minute in the second quarter . The assist - to - turnover ratio was decisive , as the Warriors recorded five more assists than the Nets , while committing five less turnovers . Golden State also dominated the rim protection , as they recorded 11 blocks to Brooklyn 's three . The Nets ( 8 - 49 ) had a nearly impossible task here , but they did a nice job of hanging around and giving the Warriors a battle . Rondae Hollis-Jefferson was a bright spot , as he accrued 16 points and 10 rebounds in the defeat . Brook Lopez really struggled , as he could only muster up nine points , four rebounds and five assists , while committing four turnovers on 3 - of - 13 shooting . Sean Kilpatrick was a nice spark off the bench , providing 15 points , 10 rebounds , two assists and two steals . Trevor Booker recorded a double - double off the bench as well , amassing 12 points and 10 rebounds . On deck for Brooklyn is a road matchup against the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday . The Warriors ( 49 - 9 ) have made minced meat of much of the league this season and a home matchup against an eight - win Nets team is simply unfair . Stephen Curry led the team with 27 points , five rebounds , five assists and three steals in the absence of Kevin Durant . Klay Thompson accumulated 24 points , four rebounds and four assists . Zaza Pachulia totaled eight points and nine rebounds , while nearly shutting out Brook Lopez . Golden State will face the Philadelphia 76ers on the road for their next game on Monday .
The Golden State Warriors ( 13 - 3 ) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 12 - 2 ) 108 - 100 in overtime of Game 1 of the NBA Finals Thursday in Oakland . The game lived up to all the hype , as the two teams battled back and forth from start to finish , but in the end , the Warriors proved to be too deep and simply outlasted the Cavaliers in overtime , where they outscored them 10 - 2 . The Warriors were led by the league MVP Stephen Curry , who , despite getting off to a slow start in the first quarter , still managed to finish with a team - high 26 points ( 10 - 20 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt ) , four rebounds and eight assists in 43 minutes of play . Golden State’s most important contributor , however , might have been Andre Iguodala off the bench , who was making big plays on both ends of the floor when his team needed them the most . Iguodala finished with 15 points ( 6 - 8 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt ) in 32 minutes off the bench . Klay Thompson did not shoot the ball particularly well Thursday night , but still managed to finish with 21 points on 5 - of - 14 shooting and six rebounds in 39 minutes . Draymond Green and Harrison Barnes round out the five Warrior players who scored in double figures , scoring 12 and 11 points respectively . LeBron James was absolutely sensational in the losing effort , putting up an NBA finals career - high 44 points ( 18 - 38 FG , 2 - 8 3Pt , 6 - 10 FT ) to go along with eight rebounds and six assists in 46 minutes of play . With a majority of the guys around him struggling offensively , James did all he possibly could to keep his team ahead . Kyrie Irving , who came into the game with questions surrounding his injured knee , did not struggle offensively and put up 23 points ( 10 - 22 FG , 2 - 8 3Pt ) , seven rebounds and six assists in 44 minutes of play . The bad news for Cleveland is that in the overtime period with the game seemingly already out of reach , Irving went down with what appeared to be a knee injury and limped to the locker room in a lot of pain . If Kyrie is unable to go , the Cavaliers are in even bigger trouble than they already were , as they will need a superman - like performance from James every game now , especially if he can’t get the support he needs from his teammates . Irving will have two days to recover , as Game 2 of the Finals is set for Sunday at 8 p.m. EST .
The Spurs managed to eclipse the 50 - percent mark from the field and three - point range , and all five players hit double digits in the scoring column . The returning Kawhi Leonard 's 32 points led the way for the Spurs , while Tony Parker followed with 18 points . LaMarcus Aldridge posted a 15 - point , 10 - rebound double - double , and Danny Green poured in 11 points . Dewayne Dedmon supplied a 10 - point , 11 - rebound double - double and Davis Bertans led the bench with nine points . Dario Saric and Jahlil Okafor turned in matching 20 - point efforts to pace the Sixers . Robert Covington stepped up with 18 points , six rebounds , one assist and two steals . Nik Stauskas was back on the bench but contributed 16 points , seven rebounds and seven assists over 32 minutes . Ersan Ilyasova chipped in 11 points , three assists , two rebounds and one steal .
The Minnesota Timberwolves ( 8 - 8 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 6 - 11 ) 101 - 91 on Friday . In a tightly - contested game , the rebounding and free - throw shooting ended up being the difference . Minnesota outrebounded Sacramento 45 - 35 and made 95 percent of their free - throws , while the Kings made just 60 percent of theirs . These are two talented teams who prefer to play up - tempo , but that was n't the case here . With a projected total of 216 , the 192 total was surprisingly low . Minnesota has been a strange team this year , as they continue to win on the road and lose at home . They are now 6 - 2 on the road and 2 - 6 at home . Usually a young team like this only plays well at home , but there 's something unique about this roster . The Timberwolves were led by Andrew Wiggins once again , who tallied 22 points and six rebounds in the win . They played this game without Ricky Rubio , but Zach LaVine filled - in admirably . LaVine amassed 19 points , eight rebounds and four assists in the victory . The 8 - 8 start is a fantastic sign for this rebuilding team and the future is extremely bright with all of these talented youngsters . The Wolves will look to keep this going against the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday . The Kings played this game without superstar DeMarcus Cousins and it clearly hampered them here . Rudy Gay is usually asked to step up in these circumstances , but he had one of the worst games of his career . In fact , Gay shot 1 - for - 13 from the field to accumulate two points and four rebounds . With a game like that and no Cousins in the lineup , it 's nearly impossible for Sacramento to win . Sacramento did however get another spectacular game out of Rajon Rondo , who tallied 16 points , 16 assists and four rebounds in the loss . The Kings will need Boogie Cousins back for their next game if they want a chance , as they have to take on the undefeated Golden State Warriors on Saturday .
The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 50 - 20 ) defeated the Denver Nuggets ( 29 - 42 ) 124 - 91 on Monday . Even without Kevin Love ( illness ) , the Cavs had no trouble exerting their will on a considerably inferior Nuggets squad , and clinching a division title in the process . LeBron James had been fairly quiet in recent games by his standards , but stepped up his role in the offense without Love in the lineup . LeBron managed his second triple - double of the season , posting 33 points , eleven rebounds and eleven assists . Cleveland outperformed Denver in every major category , and played an outstanding defensive game overall . They also managed a 56 percent success rate from the field , and a 48 percent figure from three - point range . The Nuggets were paced by a spectacular effort off the bench from Will Barton , who managed 27 points , four rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals . Nikola Jokic and Gary Harris led the starters , but it was only with a pair of 11 - point efforts . The former also added four rebounds , three assists and three steals , while the latter managed a pair of rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals . No other member of the first unit tallied double - digit points , but Jusuf Nurkic did pitch in with 11 points , seven rebounds , three assists , a steal and three blocks in 26 minutes off the bench . Denver remains in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division , and 7 games behind eighth - seeded Dallas Mavericks . They 're home against the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday . J.R. Smith followed James ' effort with 15 points , five assists , four rebounds and four steals . Channing Frye filled in admirably for Love , producing 14 points , three rebounds , two assists and a block . Matthew Dellavedova paced the bench with 10 points , seven assists and three rebounds .

The Washington Wizards ( 30 ) inched one game closer to advancing to the Eastern Conference semifinal round with a 106 - 99 victory over the Toronto Raptors ( 0 - 3 ) . After taking a 35 - 33 lead going into the second quarter , the Raptors were held to 13 points in the second frame . For the second straight postseason , Paul Pierce haunted the Raptors with another clutch shot . This time , Pierce hit a game - clinching three - pointer to give the Wizards a six - point lead with 16 seconds left . He scored 11 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter , going 3 - of - 3 from downtown and hitting both free throws . John Wall followed up 17 assists the previous game with 15 assists in 42 minutes . Marcin Gortat was responsible for eight of Wall’s assists , notching a team - high 24 points , 13 rebounds , five assists and four blocks in 42 minutes . He helped the Wizards record 13 blocks . Otto Porter contributed 11 points and eight rebounds off the bench as coach Randy Wittman continues to utilize Pierce as the nominal power forward . Amir Johnson replaced Tyler Hansbrough in the starting lineup and recorded a double - double with 14 points and 12 rebounds in 33 minutes . Even though DeMar DeRozan shot 11 - of - 29 from the floor , he scored a playoff career - high 32 points to go along with six rebounds , six assists , one steal and three three - pointers in 41 minutes . He tallied a Raptors’ franchise record 20 points in the first quarter , only to conclude the final three quarters a woeful 3 - of - 18 shooting . Battling an illness and a shin contusion , All-Star Kyle Lowry converted 5 - of - 22 field goal attempts to score 15 points in 38 minutes . To round out the futility , Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams was held to seven points on 3 - of - 11 from the field in 18 minutes . The series continues on Sunday night . A Wizards’ win advances them to the second round of the postseason while eliminating the Raptors from the playoffs .
The Toronto Raptors defeated the Boston Celtics , 107 - 97 , at Air Canada Centre on Friday evening . The Raptors ( 34 - 24 ) found out earlier in the day that star point guard Kyle Lowry would miss the game with a right wrist injury . That thrust Cory Joseph into the starting five , and , as is often the case when Lowry misses , shone a brighter spotlight on his backcourt mate DeMar DeRozan . However , his absence was also partly made up for Friday by the debuting Serge Ibaka , who was playing his first game in a Toronto uniform following his trade from the Orlando Magic . The tightly - contested affair saw the Celtics ( 37 - 21 ) enter the fourth period holding a slim 77 - 74 lead , but the home team mounted a comeback , outscoring their visitors by a 33 - 20 margin over the final 12 minutes . Isaiah Thomas once again led Boston , posting 20 points , five assists and three rebounds . However , he struggled with his shot , going 6 - of - 17 overall from the field , including 3 - of - 10 from behind the arc . Jae Crowder and Marcus Smart followed with matching 19 - point efforts , with the former adding four rebounds and one assist , and the latter supplying five rebounds and four assists over 32 minutes off the bench . Jaylen Brown drew another start at shooting guard for Avery Bradley ( Achilles ) and produced 13 points , two assists , one steal and one block . Al Horford turned in a modest stat line of eight points , five rebounds , one assist and one steal . DeRozan paced the Raptors with a spectacular career - high 43 - point tally that he supplemented with five rebounds and five assists , With Lowry out of the lineup , DeRozan took 28 shot attempts overall , draining 15 , and also visited the charity stripe a game - high 12 times . Ibaka was impressive in his debut , supplying 15 points , seven rebounds , one steal and one block . Joseph did a solid job filling in at point guard , amassing 11 points , six assists , one rebound and three steals . Patrick Patterson led the bench with 11 points , two rebounds and one assist , while P.J .

The Washington Wizards ( 31 - 15 ) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers ( 12 - 34 ) 98 - 92 on Tuesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles . Coming into halftime , the Lakers had taken a 57 - 46 lead and were playing quite well against a tough opponent . The Wizards exploded in the second half though , out - scoring the Lakers 52 - 35 over that span , giving the Wizards a six - point victory on the road . The Wizards were the better shooters in this game , going 49 percent from the field , while the Lakers shot just 43 percent . The Wizards also secured a huge 51 - 38 rebounding advantage , helping push them to a win . The Wizards ' backcourt of John Wall and Bradley Beal did most of the damage to the Lakers .

He had a poor display from the three - point line , but still finished well over his 15 points per game scoring average . With Paul Pierce sitting this game out , Otto Porter moved into the starting lineup and had a very productive game . He went 5 - for - 9 from the field and 1 - for - 1 from the three - point line to score 12 points in 29 minutes . Marcin Gortat reached double figures as well with 11 points ( 5 - 7 FG , 1 - 1 FT ) and seven rebounds of his own .

The Wizards ' next game will be on the road against the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday , while the Lakers will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Thursday .
The Utah Jazz defeated the Memphis Grizzlies , 82 - 73 , at FedExForum Arena on Sunday .

The two teams were called for a total of 48 personal fouls , with the Grizzlies ( 18 - 11 ) guilty of 28 of those . After combining for just 69 points in the first half , both offenses picked it up in the third period , and the Jazz ( 18 - 10 ) was able to finally separate in the fourth quarter .

The Miami Heat ( 23 - 30 ) defeated the New York Knicks ( 10 - 44 ) 111 - 87 on Friday . Goran Dragic was acquired from the Suns in a deadline deal on Thursday . He was unavailable Friday night but the move may have sparked a fire under Mario Chalmers . Chalmers shot just 4 - of - 14 from the floor but had seven assists , six rebounds and eight steals . Shabazz Napier also had a nice game . The rookie had 18 points , six assists and seven rebounds , but he did turn the ball over seven times . The Heat got some bad news late Thursday night about the condition of Chris Bosh . Bosh has a blood clot and could potentially miss the remainder of the season . Miami banded together and eight of their nine players scored at least 12 points in the blowout victory . The Knicks lost out on the Goran Dragic sweepstakes to the Heat on Thursday and then lost to Miami on Friday . Langston Galloway continues to be one of the few bright spots for New York this season .

It was another monster day for Cleveland 's big three consisting of LeBron James , Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving , as they combined to score 79 of the teams 128 points Thursday night . This has been nothing new for the Cavaliers ' stars this season , as they are scoring a combined 70 points per game through the first five game of the season . If the big three can continue to score at this high of a rate , especially Kevin Love , this team will give defenses problem all year .

After scoring a combined 27 points in his first four games as a pro , Brown made the most of his 35 minutes of playing time , scoring 19 points on 8 - of - 16 shooting from the field , which included three 3 - pointers .
The Charlotte Hornets ( 37 - 28 ) defeated the Houston Rockets ( 33 - 33 ) 125 - 109 on Saturday . The Hornets came into the game riding a six - game win streak , and came out of the gate against Houston looking like it . They raced out to a 34 - 19 lead after one period on the strength of solid first quarters from their stalwart trio of Kemba Walker , Nicolas Batum and Marvin Williams . The Rockets woke from their slumber in the middle periods , winning the second and third quarters by a margin of 68 - 56 , but Charlotte managed to regain their grip on the game in the fourth and pull away for their 25th home victory of the season .

The Houston Rockets defeated the Philadelphia 76ers , 115 - 88 , at Wells Fargo Center on Monday . James Harden had no problem leading the Rockets ( 6 - 4 ) past the 76ers ( 1 - 9 ) on the road . The de facto leader of the Rockets commanded the floor and spread the court to his liking against a big man heavy Philadelphia squad . Houston took a 12 - point lead at the end of the first quarter and simply expanded on it , all the way up to as much as 30 points late in the second half . Philadelphia only managed eight points from halfway through the third quarter to the end of that period , which put the game completely out of reach . The bright spot for the 76ers continues to come from Joel Embiid , who played well over his 23 minutes , save for the six turnovers during that span . Embiid went on to score 13 points , grabbed 10 rebounds , blocked two shots and added one steal on 6 - of - 10 shooting .

In a game between the sixth and seventh seeds in the East , Milwaukee prevailed thanks in part to an excellent shooting performance . The Bucks finished the night shooting 55 % from the floor as a team . Miami entered Tuesday 's contest without Luol Deng and Chris Andersen , but things got worse when Dwayne Wade exited the game with a hamstring injury . Although Wade did n't injure the same hamstring that sidelined him earlier this month , it was still severe enough to force him from the game . Milwaukee improved to 13 - 12 on the road after Tuesday 's victory . Power forward Ersan Ilyasova left the game with a groin injury and did not return , but the Bucks were resilient . Milwaukee had seven players score in double figures , with four of them coming off the bench . The Bucks will look to further solidify their playoff position Thursday against the Magic in Orlando .

Hassan Whiteside , who garnered national attention with his 12 block performance against the Bulls on Sunday , had another strong game . Whiteside moved into the starting lineup and finished the game with 16 points and 16 rebounds , but ironically did not record a block against the Bucks . The Heat have two days off to get healthy before taking the floor Friday against the Mavericks .
After being traded from Los Angeles to Houston , Lou Williams wasted no time making his presence felt with his new team . In his first three games with the Rockets , Williams averaged 24 points in just over 26 minutes off the bench . However , in his last three games , Williams ' production has dipped severely , and his performance Monday was the very worst of them .

This has been somewhat of a theme for New Orleans ( 0 - 8 ) , who has played many teams closely this season but has yet to record a win .

The Pelicans will visit Milwaukee on Thursday , while the Kings will host the Lakers .

The Wizards ( 16 - 16 ) learned earlier in the day that Bradley Beal would rest his sprained right ankle against the Nets ( 8 - 24 ) , which pushed Sheldon McClellan into the starting lineup alongside John Wall . Beal 's absence was rather easy to overcome , however , as Washington dominated a reeling Brooklyn squad that 's only won one road game all season from the opening tip . Wall led the way for the Wizards ' first unit with a 19 - point , 14 - assist double - double that also included two rebounds , four steals and a block . The home team also received standout performances from Marcin Gortat and Wall 's backup Trey Burke , who paced the team overall with a season - high 27 points .

Despite an evenly played game , the Raptors forced the Sixers into 16 turnovers , while committing just 11 of their own , which may have made just enough of a difference to push the Raptors to a victory on the road in Philadelphia on Monday . Leading the Raptors was DeMar DeRozan , who was nearly unstoppable in this one . He went 12 - for - 24 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 35 points , while also adding nine rebounds and five assists . DeRozan also forced his way to the free throw line , and converted on a perfect 10 - of - 10 attempts .

The New York Knicks ( 24 - 33 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 17 - 39 ) 103 - 95 on Saturday . The Knicks got off to a hot start here and stepped on the Wolves throats early .

The rebounding was key , as New York snatched down 51 rebounds to Minnesota 's 31 . The Knicks also shot 51 percent from the field , while holding the Timberwolves to 43 percent shooting .

The Washington Wizards ( 18 - 19 ) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks ( 16 - 25 ) 106 - 101 on Wednesday . On the same day that the Wizards welcomed back one key starter that they 'd notably missed over the last month , they received bad news on another key component of their squad . Wednesday night saw the return of Bradley Beal after he was sidelined 16 games with a lower leg injury . However , the team also learned earlier in the day that Marcin Gortat had developed an infection in his ailing knee , and would be sidelined for a second consecutive game . His defensive presence was particularly missed , as the Wizards managed to escape with a hard - fought victory despite the Bucks getting the better of them down low , and also outscoring them in the third quarter , 31 - 15 . Both Greg Monroe and Giannis Antetokoumpo managed double - doubles , and Milwaukee outrebounded Washington on the defensive glass by the considerable margin of 37 - 9 . They also outscored the Wizards in the paint , 62 - 38 , two figures that likely would have been drastically different had Gortat 's stout defense been in between the Bucks and the basket . Milwaukee was led by another outstanding performance from Khris Middleton , who has truly come into his own and hit his stride offensively . The 24 - year - old tallied a game - high 25 points and added five rebounds , five assists and two steals , the fourth time in the last five games he 's scored 20 or more points . Monroe took advantage of a clearer path down low in Gortat 's absence , managing 21 points , 12 rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals . Antetokounmpo was right behind him with his own 19 - point , 11 - rebound effort that also included six assists , two steals and a block . Even second - year pro Jabari Parker got in on the fun , posting a season - high 22 points and supplementing it with six rebounds , an assist and a steal . The Bucks fell to 16 - 25 and remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They now head back home and await the Atlanta Hawks for a Friday showdown . The Wizards enjoyed double - digit scoring nights from each of their five starters , who were unsurprisingly led by John Wall . The All-Star point guard collected 19 points , eight assists , five rebounds , a steal and a block . Jared Dudley was next in line with a 13 - point , six - rebound outing , and took away the ball three times on the night as well . Nene Hilario did a solid job in Gortat 's stead for the second straight contest , pitching in with 12 points , three assists , two rebounds and two blocks . He also had a trio of thefts , in what would become somewhat of a running theme throughout the game . Garrett Temple , likely starting his last game in place of Beal , was solid with 11 points , five assists , four rebounds and a block , while amassing five steals as well . Otto Porter rounded things out for the first unit with 10 points , two rebounds , an assist and a steal . Ramon Sessions paced the reserves with 15 points , five assists and a rebound over a highly efficient 22 minutes , and Beal looked good while pouring in 11 points , hauling three rebounds , dishing out three assists and also collecting a steal . In total , Washington was able to induce a whopping 27 turnovers from Milwaukee , which they converted into 36 points . Washington improved to 18 - 19 and moved into fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They now head to Indiana to face the Pacers on Friday .
The Milwaukee Bucks ( 7 - 5 ) defeated the Brooklyn Nets ( 4 - 7 ) 122 - 118 in a triple - overtime thriller in Brooklyn at the Barclays Center . For the Bucks , the young core of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker helped lead the team to victory . Jabari Parker had a career - high 23 points ( 8 - 13 FG , 7 - 10 FT ) as he was able to consistently score against the aging Nets defense . Meanwhile , Antetokounmpo continues his solid play with 18 points ( 7 - 11 FG , 4 - 8 FT ) and 12 rebounds . Off the bench , Ersan Ilyasova thrived against the Nets as he had a solid 14 point performance ( 7 - 12 FG ) . Despite the Nets hard - fought defeat , Brook Lopez was an absolute monster against the Bucks interior defense , as he had an efficient 26 point ( 11 - 19 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) and seven rebound performance , that included some key offensive boards in the later stages of the game . The back - court duo of Deron Williams ( 7 - 14 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt ) and Bojan Bogdanovic ( 7 - 16 FG , 4 - 11 3Pt ) combined to score 37 points , as they helped keep the team close for the entire game . The Bucks continue their road swing by going to Toronto for a Friday night game , while Brooklyn will head to Oklahoma City to face the Thunder on Friday .
Indiana have been dominant at home all season and this 21 - point win only adds to their resume ' .

Indiana ended up shooting 53 percent from the field , while holding Charlotte to 40 percent from the field and just 13 percent from three - point range . Rebounding was huge as well , with the Pacers winning that battle , 42 - 30 . Frank Kaminsky led the team in scoring off the bench , as he totaled 20 points and four rebounds . Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was the only starter in double figures , as he provided just 10 points , one rebound and one assist .

The Dallas Mavericks ( 1 - 3 ) defeated the Houston Rockets ( 3 - 1 ) 121 - 109 on Sunday in Dallas in game four of their first round matchup for the Western Conference playoffs . The Rockets came out and had a really quick start , out - scoring the Mavericks 34 - 25 right away in the first quarter . It was the Mavericks who came out hot in the second though , as they out - scored the Rockets by 17 in that quarter to take an eight - point lead into the break . After the Mavericks extended their lead with a strong third quarter , the Rockets made one last run in the fourth . They got to within nine points , but the Mavericks were able to seal the deal and keep their playoff hopes alive by avoiding elimination with a win . The Mavericks shot 54 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three - point line , while the Rockets went 47 percent from the floor and just 23 percent from deep . The Mavericks were led by some big lines from their backcourt duo of JJ Barea and Monta Ellis . Ellis went 13 - for - 21 from the field and 2 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 31 points , while also adding six rebounds and three assists . Ellis has been very effective over the last two games of this series , combining for 65 points and 12 assists , while shooting over 60 percent from the field . He 'll have to continue with that scoring momentum if the Mavericks want any chance at staying alive in this series . Barea was the biggest surprise in this game as he was very effective as a starter . Barea scored 17 points ( 7 - 15 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) , to go along with 13 assists , which was just the second time all season he reached double - digit assists . Barea was a big part in giving this team a spark in the second quarter , which is where he scored 10 of his 17 points . That run helped give the Mavericks momentum , so he was a huge reason for the Mavericks ' success . Like Barea , Al-Farouq Aminu has also been a nice surprise for the Mavericks and he had a solid performance again with 16 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt , 1 - 3 FT ) and 12 rebounds . He was coming off a 15 - point performance in game three , so he did n't disappoint with another impressive outing . Dirk Nowitzki added 16 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and eight rebounds as well . As expected , the Rockets saw James Harden do a large portion of the scoring . He went 7 - for - 15 from the field , but just 1 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score 24 points , while also adding five rebounds and five assists . Harden forced his way to the line , making all nine of his free throw attempts as well . While the production from Harden was expected , most did n't think the Rockets ' bench was going to play as well as they did . Both Josh Smith and Corey Brewer were just as important in keeping the Rockets in this game as Harden was . Smith really had his shot dialed in . He went 8 - for - 10 from the floor and 4 - for - 5 from deep to score 23 points , to go along with six rebounds and three assists . He did receive a technical foul though after shoving Devin Harris while he was intentionally fouling him . Brewer , on the other hand , chipped in with 22 points ( 9 - 15 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and five rebounds while playing 32 minutes . The Rockets ' bench out - scored the Mavericks ' bench 49 - 31 , but it was n't enough to give them the win . The Rockets really struggled on the boards , as they were out - rebounded 52 - 38 . That included 16 offensive rebounds for the Mavericks , which gave them multiple second chance opportunities . Dwight Howard and Tyson Chandler also were given technical fouls after they got into a tussle of their own . These two teams will head back to Houston and face off again in game five on Tuesday .
The Memphis Grizzlies ( 32 - 22 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 17 - 38 ) 109 - 104 on Friday . The entertaining back - and - forth affair featured new - look lineups for both clubs , although the bigger facelift was on the side of the hometown Grizzlies . While Minnesota 's Andrew Wiggins slid over to small forward to make room for two - time Slam Dunk Contest champ Zach LaVine at shooting guard , Memphis began life in earnest without the sidelined Marc Gasol ( foot ) and the jettisoned Jeff Green and Courtney Lee . JaMychal Green helped to fortify the front court in Gasol 's stead , while part - time starters Matt Barnes and Tony Allen took the place of the latter two . All of the aforementioned players managed solid - to - stellar performances in their new roles , leading to a highly competitive matchup that the Grizzlies were able to triumph in due in to their superior shooting and ball security . Memphis was able to outperform Minnesota 49 percent to 41 percent from the field , while eliciting 20 turnovers from the visitors and only committing 14 of their own . Minnesota was led by LaVine 's 22 points , which he complemented with a pair of rebounds and a steal . Wiggins was n't far behind , tallying 20 points , five assists , a pair of rebounds and a steal .

Karl-Anthony Towns pitched in with 11 points and 15 boards of his own , along with three assists , a steal and two blocks . Shabazz Muhammad and Kelvin Martin contributed a pair of 12 - point efforts to lead the bench . The former also supplied three rebounds and an assist , while the latter contributed a pair of boards and an assist . The Timberwolves remain in last place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They head home to face off against the New York Knicks on Saturday night . As expected , Mike Conley took charge of the offense in the absence of the aforementioned trio of players , totaling 25 points , seven assists , four rebounds and two steals . Zach Randolph was next in line with a 17 - point , eight - rebound effort that also included an assist . Barnes pitched in with 11 points , five boards , two assists , two steals and a block . Green came within a point of a double - double , hauling in 11 boards , handing out two assists , and recording three steals and three blocks . Allen supplied nine points , two rebounds , two assists and a steal . Veteran Vince Carter turned back the clock in pacing the reserves , recording a season - high 15 points , and adding four rebounds and a pair of steals . The Grizzlies remain in second place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They now head to Toronto to take on the Raptors in a Sunday showdown .
Death , taxes , and Russell Westbrook triple - doubles . The All-Star point guard recorded his 24th triple - double of the season against New Orleans , posting a line of 27 points , 12 rebounds , and 10 assists . Numbers like those have become commonplace for the superstar , who is on pace to become the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple - double in a season . Westbrook also looks poised to eclipse Wilt Chamberlain 's record 41 triple - doubles in a season , a feat that many once considered unachievable . For the Thunder , big men Steven Adams and Enes Kanter made big impacts as well . Adams had 20 points , 11 rebounds , and four blocks , while Kanter had 17 points and 10 rebounds off the bench .

The Milwaukee Bucks ( 20 - 27 ) defeated the Orlando Magic ( 20 - 24 ) 107 - 100 on Tuesday night . The Bucks shot nearly 50 percent from the field and 84 percent from the free - throw line while holding the Magic to just 41 percent shooting . Orlando was actually lights out from three - point range , going 13 for 24 , but it was n't enough to avoid losing for the 11th time in its last 12 games . Victor Oladipo finished with 18 points and five assists , while Nikola Vucevic had 16 points and 12 rebounds for the Magic .

The Houston Rockets ( 1 - 3 ) parlayed a record - breaking 45 - point first quarter into a 128 - 115 win over the Golden State Warriors ( 3 - 1 ) . Stephen Curry suffered a head contusion in the first half , passed concussion protocol , and returned in the middle of the third quarter with his team down 10 . The Rockets pulled ahead 45 - 22 after the first quarter and built a 25 - point lead in the second quarter before allowing the Warriors to pull within six points in the fourth quarter . The win marks their fourth this postseason when facing elimination and first over the Warriors all season . James Harden , the MVP runner - up , scored a playoff career - high 45 points , as many as his team scored in the first quarter . He added nine rebounds , five assists , two steals , two blocks and seven three - pointers in 40 minutes . Dwight Howard was assessed a Flagrant Foul 1 for elbowing Andrew Bogut in the head , a maneuver that led to an ejection for Al Horford in the Eastern Conference Finals . Should the league upgrade the blow to a Flagrant Foul 2 , Howard will be suspended for Game 5 due to an accrued four flagrant foul points during the postseason . Josh Smith added 20 points on 7 - of - 8 from the field and 3 - of - 12 free - throw shooting in 28 minutes . Stephen Curry appeared tentative upon reentering the game . He missed his first three shots in the second half and finished with 23 points on 7 - of - 18 shooting . He compiled four assists and one rebound in 31 minutes of action . All eyes will be fixed on Curry over the next 48 hours , monitoring his health as the team flies back home . Shaun Livingston , who started the second half , would likely move into the starting lineup if anything lingers on Curry 's behalf . Klay Thompson finally performed to his All-Star stature , scoring 16 of his team - high 24 points in the second quarter . After going 4 - of - 22 from downtown in the first two games , he responded by converting 6 - of - 13 three - pointers in Game 4 . Prior to fouling out , Draymond Green contributed 21 points , a game - high 15 rebounds , five blocks , four assists and two three - pointers in 40 minutes .

The Warriors have only lost three games all year at home .

One would not have guessed that based on Sunday 's game , however , as the Timberwolves shot 57 percent from the field while out - rebounding the Suns 41 - 30 . The Wolves also had a huge advantage at the free - throw line , knocking down 31 of a whopping 40 free - throw attempts as opposed to the Suns ' paltry 14 for 25 . Minnesota 's pair of first - overall picks shone brightly in just 50 combined minutes , with Andrew Wiggins delivering 18 points to go with four assists and four rebounds and Karl-Anthony Towns going for 14 points , eight rebounds , and three blocks . The Suns now stand in a similar position to Minnesota , having lost 13 of their last 14 . Phoenix 's downward spiral has been due in large part to star point guard Eric Bledsoe 's season - ending meniscus injury . The guard was averaging 20 points per game and also sat in the top 10 in the NBA in steals per game prior to his injury . On Sunday , the team simply failed to click on all levels , shooting just 43 percent including a disastrous 20 percent from beyond the arc . Phoenix had major issues with ball movement , racking up just 16 assists on the night . The Suns ' next matchup will be against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday .

The Hawks will host the Orlando Magic on Friday . Philadelphia has won two of their last four games , showing greater cohesion on the court since Tony Wroten went down with a knee injury six games ago , opening the door to allow Michael Carter-Williams to operate as the lone primary ball - handler . Alexey Shved returned to the lineup after missing three games with a hip injury . He played 16 minutes off the bench and finished with 13 points . Wroten is targeting a return to the court Friday when the Sixers take on the Nets in Brooklyn .

Los Angeles has dropped two straight games . Prior to their most recent losses , the Clippers went on a nine - game win streak in what will probably prove to be the easiest stretch of their schedule this season . Confronted with more top - level teams , the Clippers have buckled , and with Spencer Hawes ( knee ) sitting out Saturday , they lacked depth in the frontcourt , putting an even greater onus on their starting lineup . Chris Douglas-Roberts returned from a 17 - game absence with an Achilles injury to play six minutes off the bench . Matt Barnes scored a game - high 26 points , and Chris Paul turned the ball over six times in what was an all - around obtuse game for the Clippers . They 'll look to end the protraction of their losing streak when they host the Detroit Pistons on Monday .

On the whole , though , it was a very good shooting night for the Suns , as the team hit over 50 percent of its shots and almost 93 percent from the line .

The Oklahoma City Thunder ( 27 - 12 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 12 - 27 ) 101 - 96 on Tuesday night . This was a major mismatch on paper , but this game was closer than expected . Minnesota actually made a huge run in the fourth quarter to nearly cap off a double - digit comeback . What killed Minnesota once again were it 's starters , as they amassed just 41 points between the five of them . That 's actually less points than Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook combined who scored 52 of their own .

Westbrook and Durant once again carried the load , as they combined for 52 points , 14 rebounds and 14 assists in the win . Enes Kanter continued his fantastic bench production , as he scored 18 points in less than 20 minutes of action . It 's quite bizarre actually , considering Kanter is ranked as one of the 10 best big men in the NBA on a per - minute rate . They simply need to get him some more minutes if the Thunder want to get to their full potential . Oklahoma City 's next game will be on Wednesday against the Dallas Mavericks . The Timberwolves are easily one of the worst home teams in the NBA , but they played well here . They are now just 5 - 17 at Target Center and it 's a wonder why such a young team is so bad in their home arena . In any case , most of their youngsters played great here , as Shabazz Muhammad , Zach LaVine and Andrew Wiggins all scored at least 20 points . LaVine put in the most impressive line , as he accumulated 21 points , nine rebounds and four assists in one of his best games of the season . Minnesota will look to get out of this slump in their next game when they take on the Houston Rockets on Wednesday .

DeMarre Carroll and Pascal Siakam totaled a modest 14 points , but Terrence Ross ' and Patrick Patterson 's combined 26 points off the bench helped make up for the scoring void .

Thomas scored a game - high 28 points behind a sharp 4 - 6 three - point shooting night , and he added four rebounds and three assists . Jae Crowder poured in 25 on a ruthlessly efficient 11 - 15 shooting night as he added three three - pointers of his own . The Celtics were spreading the ball around , as they recorded assists on 24 of their 40 made baskets and had four players with at least three dimes . Paul George led the Pacers with 23 points , but he shot a poor 7 - 20 from the floor and turned the ball over five times . Ian Mahinmi mustered a double - double with 10 points and 10 rebounds . The Pacers just could n't overcome their poor shooting , though , as they shot a brutal 5 - 30 from the three - point line ( 17 percent ) , including an 0 - 9 night from C.J . Miles .

Each other Rocket starter scored in double figures as the team shot a scorching 59 percent from the field and dished out 40 total assists .

Garrett Temple got a spot start and scored a team - high 20 points in 30 minutes , while the next highest scoring total for Sacramento was Anthony Tolliver 's 12 points on top of his 10 assists . The Kings struggled shooting from the field , managing to shoot just 42 percent overall , and they only managed to shoot 11 total free throws on the night . To make matters worse , the Kings have now lost six of their last eight games and the organization has little reason to be optimistic going forward .

Despite an impressive top - six players on their roster , the Pelicans are woefully thin on the bench , and the absence of Eric Gordon ( shoulder ) has impacted their ability to win games more than it should , but coach Monty Williams has been unable to find a viable fill - in on his bench .

The Sacramento Kings defeated the Brooklyn Nets 122 - 105 at Golden 1 Center on Sunday . The Kings ( 7 - 10 ) ran away with their seventh win of the season in the third quarter against the Nets ( 4 - 12 ) . After Brooklyn took a four point lead into the second quarter , the Kings bounced back and went into the half down just one point . DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay went to work in the third quarter on both ends of the floor , where the Kings outscored the Nets 34 - 18 and did not have to look back the rest of the contest .

Cousins was dominant from every inch of the floor , and that included an impressive 4 - of - 5 from behind the arc and 7 - of - 9 from the free throw line . The Nets had no response once Cousins got going , and the floor being spaced favored Rudy Gay to work off the dribble . Four Nets starters finished in double figures including Sean Kilpatrick , who led the Nets in that department with 22 points , to go along with five rebounds and three assists .

The Hornets shot 30 percent from the floor for much of the game , but were able to bump that number up to 35 percent when the game was already well out of hand . With the win , the Pacers locked up the head - to - head tiebreaker over the Hornets , which could be the deciding factor for the eighth spot in the East . Charlotte was already missing Cody Zeller and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist coming into this contest , and Al Jefferson missed the second half with continued knee soreness . The dearth of depth was ultimately too much to overcome for the Hornets , and their usual scorers did not come close to their usual offensive production .

The Milwaukee Bucks ( 11 - 18 ) defeated the Phoenix Suns ( 12 - 17 ) 101 - 95 on Sunday . The Bucks have been playing some bad basketball of late aside from their historic Golden State Warriors victory , but looked good today . Milwaukee really struggled at the free - throw line , but made up for it by shooting over 50 percent from the field . The second half is when the tides really turned , as the Bucks outscored the Suns by 14 over the final 24 minutes . The Bucks had to play this game without Giannis Antetokounmpo and it really didn’t effect them as much as expected .

Middleton scored a team - high 26 points and dished out seven assists , while Carter-Williams tallied 20 points , nine rebounds and six assists .

The Suns really struggled to get their potent offense going in this game and it 's evident through the stats . No player scored more than 18 points and the starters combined for just 52 points . T.J. Warren and Eric Bledsoe both scored a team - high 18 points and went a combined 9 - for - 9 from the free - throw line .

The Charlotte Hornets ( 23 - 25 ) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers ( 9 - 41 ) 101 - 82 at Staples Center on Sunday . As the halfway point of the season has passed , and the upcoming all - star break is around the corner , the Lakers will likely look to start thinking about 2016 - 2017 and the NBA Draft because it was the same story with Los Angeles , who picked up their 10th straight loss and dropped to 4 - 24 at home . Kobe Bryant played to the delight of the hometown crowd , and provided one of his better performances of the season , as he finished with 23 points , eight rebounds and three assists on 8 - of - 18 shooting in 23 minutes . The rout was on early for Charlotte , who stretched a double figure lead and danced around a 30 point blowout for most of the second half .

Russell contributed 10 points , six rebounds and one assist off the bench . Julius Randle strung together another double - double with 10 points and 11 rebounds , while his frontcourt partner , Roy Hibbert , finished with zero points and two boards in a weak showing from the veteran . Kemba Walker’s torrid shooting did not have a large impact on the Hornets all around effort , as the frontcourt combination of Michael Kidd-Gilchrist , who made his season debut on Friday against the Blazers , and Marvin Williams contributed 38 points and 24 rebounds . Even more impressively , they combined to go 6 - of - 10 from behind the arc , which constantly kept the game far out of reach from the Lakers . Nobody else on the Hornets was nearly as polarizing as the two forwards , but a bright spot came from rookie Frank Kaminsky , who finished with 11 points in 23 minutes off the bench . The Lakers will host the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 14 - 35 ) on Tuesday , while the Hornets will entertain LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 34 - 12 ) on Wednesday .

Isaiah Thomas led the team with 22 points , while also dishing out six assists , Jared Sullinger was huge down low , as he amassed 21 points and 12 rebounds . Up next for the Celtics is a matchup with the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday .

Steph Curry scored 22 points in the third quarter , but really struggled aside from that . In fact , Curry had just seven points in the other three quarters and committed nine turnovers in the defeat . Draymond Green had another great all - around game though , as he accumulated 16 points , nine rebounds , seven assists and six steals . On deck for the Warriors is a matchup with the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday .

For Indiana , both Paul George and Myles Turner returned to the lineup after missing time with ankle injuries , but even that was n't enough to get past the Hawks .

Turner could n't get anything going on the offensive end , posting just seven points on top of nine rebounds in his return . It was Thaddeus Young who ended up leading the way for the Pacers , posting a game - high 24 points on 10 - of - 13 shooting and seven rebounds in 41 minutes .

Chris Paul struggled offensively with just two points ( 1 - 6 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt ) , but made up for it by notching 15 assists , as his teammates were knocking down everything they could get their hands on . Adreian Payne did everything he could to keep the Timberwolves in this game . He went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the free throw line to finish with a team - high of 16 points , while adding 15 rebounds and a blocked shot over 37 minutes . It was his second double - double of the season in just his third career start , while he set season - highs in both points and rebounds in the loss as well . Posting a double - double of his own , Nikola Pekovic recorded 12 points ( 5 - 12 FG , 2 - 4 FT ) and 10 rebounds in 23 minutes . It marked his first double - double over his last three games , after posting five straight previous to that . He 's now averaging 13 points and 8 rebounds on the season .

The Los Angeles Clippers took down the host Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday , 133 - 109 . The Clippers ( 43 - 29 ) came off a convincing win on Monday by blowing out their hometown rival Lakers on Tuesday . The starting backcourt of Chris Paul and J.J. Redick was dominant , with Paul pouring in 27 points and Redick adding 24 . Perimeter play was the driving force of the dominant win , as the Clips shot over 53 percent from the field while sinking 15 three - pointers . Another area in which the Clippers thrived was free - throw shooting ; the team reached the line 32 times and hit a whopping 28 free - throws on the night . The Lakers ( 20 - 51 ) are on a six - game losing streak and appear to be right where they want to be , as the team shut down many of its veterans for the remainder of the season in part due to desire to keep their own draft pick . Tuesday 's loss at Staples Center was a particularly brutal one , however , as the team fell to its divisional rival on its home court . The team shot just 63 percent from the free - throw line and went an abysmal 5 - of - 19 from beyond the arc . One bright spot for the Lakers , however , was rookie Brandon Ingram , who led the team with 21 points on 8 - of - 14 shooting . The Clippers will visit Dallas on Thursday , while the Lakers will host the Timberwolves on Friday .
The Golden State Warriors ( 47 - 4 ) defeated the Houston Rockets ( 27 - 27 ) 123 - 110 on Tuesday night . The Warriors got off to a hot start , as they scored 42 points in the first quarter to take a 15 - point lead . They never really looked back after that despite allowing the Rockets to crawl back in the third quarter . Golden State shot 47 percent from the field and recorded 28 assists on their 44 made baskets . The game was tied heading into the fourth quarter , but the Warriors outscored the Rockets 30 to 17 over the final 12 minutes . Houston had a tough task here as a double - digit underdog , but did a good job of hanging around all night . James Harden once again carried the load , as he tallied 37 points , five rebounds , five assists and three steals in the loss . Dwight Howard also played well , as he double - doubled in a 16 - point , 15 - rebound performance . The Rockets have a quick turnaround , as they play the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday in the second half of a back - to - back set . The Warriors didn’t play their cleanest game , but they extended their undefeated home winning streak to 23 games on the season . Steph Cwas the catalyst once again , as he accumulated 35 points , nine assists and five rebounds in the win . Andrew Bogut was the darkhorse hero though , as he double - doubled while also recording six blocks and three steals in a defensive showcase . Golden State 's last game before the All-Star break will be on Wednesday when they play the Phoenix Suns .
The Toronto Raptors ( 45 - 30 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 16 - 59 ) 113 - 99 on Wednesday . The Raptors got a good team effort in an easy win for them in Minnesota . No Toronto player garnered more than 30 minutes or scored 20 points , but seven players scored in double - figures . They were led by Louis Williams , who put in a team - high 18 points in 26 minutes off the bench . Toronto has the same record as the Chicago Bulls as they 'll battle for playoff position the rest of the regular season . The banged up Wolves played just eight players against the Raptors . Probably rookie of the year Andrew Wiggins was the man against his hometown team . He put in 25 points to go along with five boards , five assists , two blocks and one steal . His teammate rookie point guard Zach LaVine had a solid game with 22 points and seven rebounds but recorded seven turnovers and just three assists .

The Miami Heat ( 19 - 13 ) defeated the Dallas Mavericks ( 19 - 14 ) 106 - 82 on Friday . Perennial All-Star Dwyane Wade was not expected to play after experiencing flu - like symptoms Friday afternoon . However , the veteran decided to tough things out and remain active in a reserve role , in an effort to help the Heat put a halt to a recent cold spell that had seen them lose three of their last five contests . The move paid off , as the 33 - year - old collected 10 points , seven assists , two rebounds and a steal over just 19 minutes off the bench . Miami was able to dominate the contest with outstanding shooting and highly productive performances from their starters as well , as they tallied an impressive 56 shooting percentage from the field , and a solid 44 percent from beyond the arc . Meanwhile , their suffocating defense stymied Dallas to the tune of 36 and 23 percent tallies , respectively , in those categories . As evidenced by the final score and the aforementioned team shooting figures , the Mavericks obviously had significant trouble making a dent on the scoreboard , and their top scorer netted only 14 points . That player was surprisingly Zaza Pachulia , who did also add 13 rebounds , an assist , a steal and a block . Wesley Matthews ( 12 points , four rebounds and an assist ) and Dirk Nowitzki ( 11 points , three rebounds , an assist and a steal ) were the only other starters in double figures points - wise , while Charlie Villanueva and Deron Williams led the reserves with a pair of nine - point efforts . J.J. Barea , drawing the start for Williams , could only contribute six points and five assists . Dallas dropped to 19 - 14 and currently resides in second place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head home to face the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday . The Heat 's starting five was spearheaded by a monster double - double from Hassan Whiteside that was reminscent of many of his dominant performances from his breakout 2014 - 15 campaign . The four - year pro managed 25 points and a season - high 19 rebounds , along with a block . Chris Bosh poured in 16 points and added seven rebounds and four assists , while Goran Dragic continued his recent stretch of solid offensive play with 15 points , seven assists , four rebounds and three steals . In addition to Wade 's strong performance off the bench , Gerald Green made a splash with a 19 - point , three - rebound , two - assist effort over 33 minutes that paced the Miami reserves . While Tyler Johnson ( eight points , three rebounds ) drew the start in Wade 's stead , Green got hot from the field and received some extra run as a result . The Heat improved to 19 - 13 and have vaulted into second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division by virtue of their victory and the Magic 's loss to the Wizards earlier in the evening . They now hit the road to face off against the Wizards on Sunday .
The Memphis Grizzlies ( 33 - 23 ) won a shootout Wednesday night over the Los Angeles Lakers ( 11 - 48 ) at FedExForum , 128 - 119 . The Lakers hit 17 three - pointers , a season high , but the Grizzlies set a season high in threes of their own with 13 and shot a brilliant 57 percent as they managed withstand Los Angeles 's surprising offensive attack . Memphis 's 128 points also marked a season high , the previous being 122 against Oklahoma City way back in November . Matt Barnes hit five three - pointers as he scored a team - high 25 points ( 9 - 14 FG ) for the Grizzlies . Mike Conley scored 24 ( 10 - 14 FG , 2 - 4 3PT ) and added eight assists , and P.J . Hairston got into the three - point action , nailing four of his seven attempts as he scored 17 points . All five Grizzlies starters finished in double figures , as did Brandan Wright , who scored 15 on 7 - 10 shooting off the bench . Jordan Clarkson led all scorers with 28 as he shot 10 - 18 from the floor and a brilliant 6 - 11 from three - point range . D'Angelo Russell scored 22 ( 8 - 19 FG , 3 - 9 3PT ) and added eight assists and four rebounds and Lou Williams added 22 points in 22 minutes off the bench . But the Lakers starting frontcourt of Kobe Bryant , Julius Randle and Roy Hibbert combined to score just 25 points against 51 for Memphis 's starting front court of Barnes , Jeff Green and Zach Randolph . The Grizzlies and Lakers will finish out this home - and - home series with a rematch Friday night at Staples Center .
Goran Dragic 's 22 points led the Heat , while Hassan Whiteside 's 18 - point , 18 - rebound double - double played a pivotal role in Miami 's 48 - 38 rebounding advantage . Dion Waiters and Josh Richardson combined for 31 points on the wings , while Derrick Williams compiled 12 points over just 17 minutes in a start at power forward . James Johnson was nearly as efficient off the bench , supplying 17 points over 27 minutes . Overall , the Heat impressively posted 51 and 48 percent success rates from the field and three - point range , respectively . Wall and Beal paced the Wizards with a pair of 34 - point efforts , and the former notably drained five of his six shot attempts from beyond the arc . Marcin Gortat was the only other player to manage double digits in the scoring column , totaling 10 points , 16 rebounds , four assists and five blocks .
The Indiana Pacers ( 23 - 19 ) defeated the Phoenix Suns ( 13 - 30 ) 97 - 94 on Tuesday night . In a game between two of the fastest - paced teams in the NBA , the offenses were downright ugly tonight . Indiana came into this game ticked off with their defensive form and it 's clear they were letting out their frustrations on this beaten up Suns team . The Pacers held the Suns to just 35 percent shooting and drew 22 turnovers in a dominant defensive performance . The NBA has become a three - point shooting league , but these teams set the league back a few years by combining to go 15 - for - 55 from long range in this game . The aggressive nature of Indiana can be emphasized by the fact that they recorded 16 steals in the victory . Indiana had lost four of their last five coming into this and a date with Phoenix is just what the doctor ordered . The Pacers didn’t play pretty basketball , but they got back to their roots and dominated with their stifling defense . The defensive total actually would have looked better if the Pacers didn’t allow 16 points in the final three minutes in a comeback effort . No player played spectacularly , but Paul George did put in a nice all - around game , as he tallied 19 points , eight rebounds , four assists and four steals in the win . Mighty Joe Young also gave the team a nice spark off the bench , as he finished with 11 points , three rebounds , five assists and two steals in just 19 minutes of action . Indiana will have to keep up this defensive form in their next game against the Golden State Warriors on Friday . This Suns team has fallen apart over the last two months and it 's quite clear that the offense is the main reason why . The amazing part about this game is that Phoenix shot 27 - for - 29 from the free - throw line and still barely cracked 90 points . That 's simply hard to do and it shows how inefficient they are playing right now . The one bright spot here was rookie Devin Booker , who scored a career - high 32 points in a shooting exhibition . Markieff Morris finally seemed to be turning things around over the last few games , but he left here in the first quarter with a shoulder injury . That 's the last thing this team needs , as the injuries are killing them right now . Brandon Knight really hurt his team tonight as well , as he went 2 - for - 9 from three - point range and committed a ghastly eight turnovers in the defeat . It doesn’t get much easier in their next game , as the Suns host the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday in what will likely be another lopsided result .
The Sacramento Kings ( 29 - 53 ) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers ( 21 - 61 ) 122 - 99 on Wednesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles . Because both teams have already been eliminated from the playoffs , this gave each coaching staff another shot at evaluating talent for next season . It also cemented the Lakers into having the fourth worst record in the league , which means they 'll have the fourth best odds at getting the first overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft . The Kings dominated this game , as they went 55 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three - point line , while the Lakers finished at 38 percent from the floor and 29 percent from deep . It was the duo of Ben McLemore and Derrick Williams that helped lead the Kings to such a large victory . McLemore posted 24 points ( 9 - 18 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , five rebounds and seven assists , while Williams recorded 22 points ( 9 - 16 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 2 - 4 FT ) and six rebounds off the bench . McLemore has been very inconsistent all season long , so it was good to see him at least end with a strong performance . Williams also finished on a high note , as he combined for 42 points and seven rebounds over his final two outings . Ray McCallum chipped in with 19 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 5 - 9 FT ) and six assists , while Nik Stauskas was in the starting lineup and posted 14 points ( 5 - 9 FG , 3 - 4 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) and five assists . The Lakers were led by a huge performance from Jabari Brown . Brown went 9 - for - 19 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 32 points , while also adding three rebounds . He 's been one of the few bright spots here at the end of the season for the Lakers , as he 's averaged 22 points over his final four games . He 'll likely find himself a role somewhere next season after showing what he can do on the court this year . Vander Blue also had a solid showing , finishing with 15 points ( 6 - 23 FG , 1 - 8 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) , seven rebounds and eight assists . With so many injuries in the backcourt , the second - year guard played the whole game Wednesday and took advantage , posting career - highs in points , rebounds and assists in just his second game for the Lakers this season . Jordan Hill added 12 points ( 5 - 14 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and six rebounds as well . With both teams missing the playoffs , this marks the end of their respective seasons .
The New York Knicks ( 17 - 64 ) defeated the Atlanta Hawks ( 60 - 21 ) 112 - 108 on Monday at Philips Arena in Atlanta . While the Knicks have already been eliminated from the playoffs , this game did carry some weight in regards to their 2015 NBA Draft lottery odds . The Timberwolves now have taken over as the worst record in the league , so they 'll likely end up with the highest odds come draft day in June for that number one overall pick . The Hawks , on the other hand , were n't affected much by the loss , as they 've already locked up the number one overall seed for the playoffs in the Eastern Conference . It still has n't been determined who they 'll play yet , but it should be either the Boston Celtics , Indiana Pacers , Brooklyn Nets or Miami Heat . The Knicks were the superior shooters in this game , going 56 percent from the field and 52 percent from the three - point line , while the Hawks finished at 44 percent from the floor and just 34 percent from deep . The Knicks turned the ball over 18 times compared to just eight from the Hawks , but they were able to overcome the disparity with their strong shooting . Langston Galloway had an extremely impressive performance . He went 10 - for - 12 from the field and a perfect 6 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 26 points , while adding five rebounds and six assists as well . It was a complete turn around from Saturday 's game against the Magic where he shot just 25 percent ( 4 - 16 FG ) from the field , so the Knicks were happy to see the guard play so well with the season coming to an end . Tim Hardaway Jr. also had a very strong showing , finishing with 23 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 3 - 9 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) and five assists over 36 minutes . It was just the seventh time this season that he 's reached the 20 - point mark , as he 's averaging just 11 points on the season . Jason Smith had a big game with 20 points ( 7 - 13 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) , nine rebounds and five assists over 36 minutes as well . The Hawks ' backcourt duo of Jeff Teague and Kyle Korver did their best to pull out this win for the Hawks . Teague finished with 19 points ( 7 - 17 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , nine assists and two steals , while Korver posted 19 points ( 4 - 10 FG , 4 - 9 3Pt , 7 - 7 FT ) and five rebounds . Korver has been hitting three - pointers at a very high rate as the season has been winding down . He 's made at least three three - pointers in six of his last seven games , which bodes well for the Hawks as the playoffs begin Saturday . With Paul Millsap getting the night off in hopes of having his shoulder return closer to 100 percent , both Al Horford and DeMarre Carroll put up some points in the frontcourt . Carroll finished with 16 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) and four rebounds over 33 minutes , while Horford added 18 points ( 9 - 17 FG ) and six rebounds over 33 minutes . While the Hawks ' starters all played well , they just happened to run into the Knicks at the wrong time , as the Knicks played one of their best offensive games of the season . The Knicks ' final game of the season will be at home against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday , while the Hawks will travel to Chicago to play the Bulls on Wednesday .
The Pelicans ( 3 - 2 ) sent the Spurs ( 2 - 3 ) to their second consecutive loss Saturday night , edging out a 100 - 99 victory . New Orleans , which led by eight entering the final period , allowed San Antonio to get back into the game late , as a 12 - 4 run spurred by Kawhi Leonard cut the deficit to just two with under a minute remaining . Three Danny Green free throws would put the Spurs up one with 12 seconds to play , but Anthony Davis responded with a lay - in to put the Pelicans ahead one with six seconds remaining . San Antonio inbounded to Leonard on the ensuing possession but his three - point attempt was blocked by Tyreke Evans . Davis , the early MVP favorite , finished with 27 points ( 14 in the first half ) , 11 rebounds , six blocks and four steals to pace Milwaukee . Evans added 18 points , while Jrue Holiday chipped din 15 to go with 11 assists . Eric Gordon contributed 14 points in 38 minutes .

The Cavaliers were unable to overcome the absence of LeBron James , falling to the Thunder 103 - 94 on Thursday night . James , who sat out with soreness in his knee , is 14 - 4 against Kevin Durant in his career , but could do nothing but watch from the sidelines as Durant and Russell Westbrook stifled a late run by the Cavaliers , whose eight - game winning streak was snapped . The Thunder opened up a 20 - point lead early in the fourth quarter , courtesy of an 80 spree spurred by three - pointers by Reggie Jackson and Anthony Morrow . However , the Cavaliers responded , as a Matthew Dellavedova-led run brought Cleveland back to within four with just under two minutes to play . Following a timeout , the Thunder were able to regroup , as Kevin Durant scored Oklahoma City’s final eight points to put the game away . Durant finished with 19 points , six rebounds and five assists , converting 6 - of - 14 field goals . He continues to be on a strict 30 - minute limit , though it’s likely to be lifted in the near future . Westbrook led the way with 26 points ( 12 - 24 FG ) , eight assists and seven rebounds , while Reggie Jackson added 13 points off the bench . Serge Ibaka had just seven points and no rebounds before fouling out in 26 minutes . Cleveland , which struggled to find quality shots without James , shot a paltry 37 percent from the floor but registered 30 free throw attempts , compared to Oklahoma City’s 22 . Irving had a team - high 20 points ( 7 - 21 FG ) to go with six assists , and Kevin Love added 18 points and 16 rebounds . Dellavedova , who drew the start in place of James , finished with 14 points , including four three - pointers . Both teams are on the first night of a back - to - back set .

The Miami Heat ( 48 - 33 ) defeated the Detroit Pistons ( 43 - 38 ) 99 - 93 on Tuesday night . The Heat came in to the contest with a chance to improve their chances for better playoff positioning , as a win would put them one step closer to potentially moving all the way up to the third seed by season 's end . They did their part against Detroit , which was missing starting point guard Reggie Jackson due to an abdominal strain . However , Miami was also short - handed , with rookie Justise Winslow out with an ankle injury . All five members of the Heat first unit made key contributions to the victory , with veteran Joe Johnson spearheading the charge with 25 points , five assists , two rebounds and two steals . Miami had a solid night from the field overall , tallying a 49 percent success rate .

Goran Dragic managed 16 points , five rebounds , four assists and a steal . Hassan Whiteside supplied 14 points , nine boards , three blocks and two steals , while Dwyane Wade matched the big man 's point total and also pitched in four rebounds and three assists . The Heat are now atop the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division , and are currently slotted in the third seed as well . However , they face off with the fifth - seeded Boston Celtics in TD Garden on Wednesday night , a game that will determine final playoff positioning for both clubs . Detroit was paced by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope , who compiled 17 points , three rebounds and three steals . Tobias Harris and Marcus Morris followed with a pair of 16 - point efforts . The former added nine rebounds and an assist , while the latter supplied four rebounds , two assists , a steal and two blocks .

The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 32 - 12 ) extended their lead on the Eastern Conference with a 115 - 93 home win over the plummeting Phoenix Suns ( 14 - 33 ) . In their third game since firing coach David Blatt , the Cavs ran circles around the struggling Suns on both ends of the floor . Cleveland shot a whopping 56 percent from the field while sinking 11 three - pointers and simultaneously forcing 22 Phoenix turnovers . The team recorded an impressive 34 total assists , including nine from star LeBron James . In addition to his role as distributor , LeBron scored a highly efficient 21 points on 7 for 8 shooting from the field and 7 of 7 at the line . Power forward Kevin Love , who has been the subject of many trade rumors of late , also posted 21 points along with 11 rebounds , four assists , two steals , and two blocks . Phoenix has been struggling mightily lately , winning just two of its last 19 games . With star point guard Eric Bledsoe out for the season due to a torn meniscus , the Suns have given the reigns to their young core of players . Rookie Devin Booker has shone in a starting role , and Wednesday was no exception . Booker posted 16 points , three rebounds , and five assists , and turned the ball over just twice in 34 minutes . The Suns will have a day off before traveling to Madison Square Garden to take on the Knicks on Friday night . The Cavs , meanwhile , visit Central-Division foe Detroit on Friday .
The Cavaliers ( 19 - 7 ) held off the Knicks ( 14 - 16 ) for a 91 - 84 victory at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday . The Knicks fought tough , but were unable to handle the Cavaliers stifling defense , particularly in the fourth quarter in which New York managed just 12 points . Iman Shumpert did an excellent job defending locking down Aaron Afflalo , while LeBron James and Kevin Love each poured in 23 points . Cleveland padded its lead in the Eastern Conference standings with a sixth straight win - - the Cavaliers longest winning streak of the season was eight games earlier in the season . It was a solid effort from the Knicks without All-Star forward Carmelo Anthony , who was sidelined due to an ankle injury , thought he was expected to play earlier in the day after shootaround . In Anthony 's stead , New York turned to rookie Kristaps Porzingus , who poured in a team - high 23 points on 8 - of - 18 shooting to go along with 13 rebounds . It was a nice bounce - back game for Porzingus , as the young big man had n't scored more than 20 points since Dec. 7 against the Mavericks . He also set a new career high with four 3 - pointers made . The Cavaliers received a big boost with Kyrie Irving returning to the lineup Sunday against the 76ers , but the superstar point guard has n't been very effective . He played just 19 minutes Wednesday and was limited to five points on 1 - of - 7 shooting from the field . It 's still only been two games since Irving 's return , so chances are he 'll need a few more contests to get back into the swing of things , which the Cavaliers can certainly afford considering how well they 've played lately . Tristan Thompson posted his fifth double - double of the season with 10 points and 14 rebounds .
The Memphis Grizzlies ( 48 - 21 ) defeated the Dallas Mavericks ( 44 - 26 ) 112 - 101 on Friday in Dallas .

Devin Harris lead the way for the Mavericks , scoring 16 points on 5 - of - 6 shooting in 21 minutes off the bench . Dirk Nowitzki was close behind and was only able to record 16 points on a poor 4 - of - 14 shooting . Tyson Chandler fell just two points shy of a double - double , putting up nine points on 4 - of - 4 shooting and 13 rebounds in 36 minutes . Chandler Parsons ( 12 ) , Monta Ellis ( 12 ) , Charlie Villanueva ( 12 ) and Rajon Rondo ( 10 ) round out the six Mavericks who scored in double figures .

Up next , the Grizzlies will head home Saturday and take on the Trail Blazers , while the Mavericks will head to Phoenix on Sunday and play the Suns .

The Spurs went 47 percent from the field and 37 percent from the three - point line , while the Rockets shot 49 percent from the floor and 36 percent from beyond the arc .

The Spurs were led by Danny Green , who had a team - high of 24 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 3 - 9 3Pt ) , while also recording five steals . He got to the free throw line 10 times , and converted on nine of those attempts . The five steals were a season - high , and the points were well above his season average of 13 points per game .

He shot well , going 6 - for - 9 from the field and 1 - for - 1 from the three - point line to score 14 points in 34 minutes . He also had six rebounds and four assists . But without Parker , the Spurs also leaned on their other veterans with both Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili getting plenty of touches . Duncan finished with 16 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 4 - 5 FT ) and eight rebounds , while Ginobili came off the bench to score 15 points ( 5 - 7 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and four assists . It was a nice win for the Spurs over a quality opponent . Despite taking the loss , the Rockets had a few players that played well . James Harden led the Rockets , going 10 - for - 18 from the floor and 3 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 28 points . He also added five assists , but uncharacteristically turned the ball over nine times , which was the most he 's had all season . He was a big reason for the team turnover difference that really hurt the Rockets . Coming off the bench , Corey Brewer came out firing . He went 8 - for - 11 from the field and 6 - for - 8 from beyond the arc to score 25 points . It was a season - high for Brewer , as he seemingly could n't miss for the majority of the game . The other big contribution came from Dwight Howard who had a monster line of 24 points ( 11 - 13 FG , 2 - 7 FT ) and 17 rebounds . After scoring only six points on Friday against the Grizzlies , it was nice bounce back game for Howard . The Spurs ' next game will be on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday , while the Rockets will be at home against the Washington Wizards on Monday .
The Washington Wizards ( 38 - 28 ) needed a torrid second half shooting performance to defeat the Sacramento Kings ( 22 - 43 ) 113 - 97 on Saturday at the Verizon Center . Sacramento led by as many as 21 early in the third quarter before Washington woke up and went on a 21 - 6 run to narrow the gap . Ramon Sessions , who came over to Washington from Sacramento at the trade deadline , canned the go ahead three early in the fourth and the Wizards never looked back . DeMarcus Cousins fouled out with 5:33 remaining and the Kings could never recover , managing just nine points for the rest of the game . Sacramento 's brutal eight - game road trip finally came to an end in Washington on Saturday . The Kings went just 2 - 6 on the trip to fall further towards the bottom of the Western Conference . Rudy Gay did not suit up for this game after suffering a strained patellar tendon Friday . His replacement , Omri Casspi , managed only two points and a rebound over 15 minutes on the floor . The Kings will return home on Monday to host the Hawks . The Wizards were facing their second straight opponent that was at less than full strength after playing a Memphis team that rested three starters on Thursday . It looked ugly early on , but the Wizards managed to shift into high gear to escape with a win . John Wall put on a show with 31 points and 12 assists . Nene Hilario missed his second straight game due to personal reasons and is questionable for Washington 's next outing . The Wizards will host the Trail Blazers on Monday before embarking on a four - game Western Conference road trip .
The Dallas Mavericks ( 10 ) defeated the Phoenix Suns ( 0 - 1 ) 111 - 95 on Wednesday at Talking Stick Resort Arena in Phoenix . The Mavericks got off to a quick start during their 2015 - 16 season opener , grabbing a nine - point lead by halftime . After out - scoring the Suns 34 - 21 in the third quarter as well , the Mavericks put the game out of reach and pushed on to their first victory of the season . As a team , the Mavericks went 47 percent from the field and an impressive 48 percent from the three - point line , while the Knicks finished at 39 percent from the field and just 25 percent from deep . With Chandler Parsons ( knee ) still out , the Mavericks moved Wesley Matthews over to small forward , which gave Raymond Felton the opportunity to enter the starting lineup at shooting guard . Felton made the most of his opportunity and torched the Suns for a game - high of 18 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) , while also pitching in with six assists and four rebounds . Felton averaged just 4 points and 1 assists over 29 games with the Mavericks last season , so this was a fantastic performance for the guard . Deron Williams added 12 points ( 5 - 8 FG , 2 - 2 3Pt ) , six rebounds and an assist in his Mavericks ' debut . He had to leave the game in the third quarter with a left knee contusion , though , so we 'll have to wait and see if it forces him to miss any additional time . Dirk Nowitzki chipped in with 11 points ( 5 - 10 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt ) and nine rebounds as well . The Suns ' starting frontcourt trio of P.J . Tucker , Markieff Morris and Tyson Chandler really struggled in this one . They went a combined 3 - of - 11 from the field for just nine points , which clearly was the difference in this one . The backcourt combination of Brandon Knight and Eric Bledsoe was about all the Suns had going for them . Knight finished with 15 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) , six rebounds and three assists , while Bledsoe added 13 points ( 4 - 12 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 5 - 7 FT ) , four rebounds and four assists . Knight did turn the ball over six times , which was a big factor in pushing the Suns to a whopping 18 turnovers as a team.The Suns ' 13th overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft , Devin Booker , shined in his professional debut , as he went 6 - for - 7 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line for 14 points over 21 minutes . The Mavericks next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday , while the Suns will remain at home in a matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday .
The San Antonio Spurs ( 58 - 10 ) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers ( 35 - 34 ) 118 - 110 on Thursday . This victory gave the Spurs 43 - straight win in their home building and they used an unlikely recipe . Usually the defense wins them their games , but the offense was on point on Thursday . In fact , the Spurs shot 52 percent from the field , 91 percent from the free - throw line and 50 percent from three - point range . The ball movement was superb as well , with San Antonio recording 35 assists on 45 made baskets . Portland has been struggling recently and this is the last place you want to play in those instances . Damian Lillard and C.J . McCollum continued their great seasons though , as they scored nearly half the points in this loss . McCollum led the team with 26 points , with Lillard scoring 23 of his own . Mason Plumlee had a nice all - around game , as he totaled 12 points , eight rebounds and five assists in the defeat . On deck for the Blazers is a matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday . San Antonio just continues to take care of business , as this game never seemed like Portland had a chance . LaMarcus Aldridge and Kawhi Leonard tied the team - lead with 22 points in the win . Tony Parker may have had his best game of the season , as he scored 18 points , while dishing out a season - high 16 assists . That home record has a huge test approaching , as the Golden State Warriors come to town on Saturday for their next scheduled game .
The Portland Trail Blazers ( 37 - 35 ) defeated the Dallas Mavericks ( 36 - 35 ) 109 - 103 on Wednesday . After a 132 - 120 overtime defeat on Sunday in Dallas , the Trail Blazers came in to Wednesday looking to turn the tables . Priority one was likely putting the clamps on ageless veteran Dirk Nowitzki , who had scorched them for a season - high 40 points just three nights prior . Portland did a much more effective job Wednesday , holding the Mavs power forward to 21 points , nine rebounds , three assists and a block . Wesley Matthews did have one of his more effective nights of the season against his former teammates while posting 22 points , but Damian Lillard and the rest of the Trail Blazers starting five proved too much for the visitors . Matthews ' scoring total did pace Dallas , and he added five rebounds , an assist , two steals and a block . Salah Mejri put together another impressive outing in a second straight start , tallying a 14 - point , 12 - rebound double - double that also included an assist , a steal and a block .

Barea paced the reserves with 14 points , five assists , two rebounds and a steal . Devin Harris was also effective off the bench , totaling 11 points , four rebounds and a pair of steals . The Mavericks remain in third place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division , and are currently slotted in the seventh seed as well . They head to Oakland to take on the Golden State Warriors on Friday night . Lillard 's game - high 27 points spearheaded the Portland attack , and he complemented it with six rebounds , six assists , two blocks and a steal . He did commit seven turnovers , the only blemish on his otherwise stellar performance . Ed Davis was next with a bench - leading 16 points , which he supplemented with nine rebounds , two assists and three steals . C.J . McCollum and Maurice Harkless followed with a pair of 14 - point efforts . McCollum also dished out four assists and hauled in a rebound , while Harkless posted four rebounds , two assists , a steal and a block . Miles Plumlee pitched in with 10 points , eight boards , an assist , three steals and a pair of blocks . Al-Farouq Aminu rounded out a successful night for the starting five with 10 points , 10 rebounds , an assist , two steals and two blocks .

The Warriors turned a slim seven - point lead at halftime into a robust 29 - point edge by the end of the third quarter , as they outscored the Celtics by a 31 - 9 margin during the period . They shot 49 percent from the field overall while holding Boston to a 37 percent figure . Klay Thompson 's 28 points led the way , while Kevin Durant was close behind with a 23 - point , 10 - rebound double - double . Curry mustered a modest 16 points on a 7 - of - 20 effort from the field , which included a sub - par 2 - of - 10 performance from three - point range .

Jaylen Brown and Terry Rozier stepped up to lead the reserves with a pair of 11 - point efforts .
The New York Knicks defeated the Orlando Magic , 113 - 105 , at Amway Center on Monday evening . The Knicks ( 26 - 38 ) had announced earlier in the day that Carmelo Anthony would sit out the second game of the back - to - back set with knee soreness , which created a domino effect that saw rookie Ron Baker enter the starting five . His absence naturally put more of a scoring load on the likes of Kristaps Porzingis , Derrick Rose and Courtney Lee , and each responded with solid contributions to help New York to a road win . The Knicks made a comeback after the Magic ( 23 - 41 ) had built a 28 - 20 lead after one quarter , and did it once more in the fourth in overcoming a 92 - 85 deficit to pull away for the eight - point victory . The win snapped an 11 - game losing streak for the Knicks in games in which Anthony had not taken the court . Lee led the way with 20 points , three rebounds , two assists and one steal . Lance Thomas continued his strong play with 17 points , four boards , two steals and one assist . Porzingis supplied 14 points , seven rebounds , one assist and one block . Willy Hernangomez matched his scoring total and added eight rebounds and three assists in just 18 minutes off the bench .

Evan Fournier paced Orlando with a game - high 25 points , which he supplemented with three assists and two rebounds . Aaron Gordon tallied 17 points , five rebounds , four assists and one block . Elfrid Payton posted a 16 - point , 11 - rebound , 10 - assist triple - double that also included one steal . Bismack Biyombo , logging a second straight start in place of Nikola Vucevic ( Achilles ) , provided a second consecutive double - double with 10 points , 14 rebounds and one block . Jeff Green paced the bench with 15 points , one rebound and one block . The Knicks remain on the road and face off with the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night , while the Magic are home again Wednesday evening as they take on the Chicago Bulls .
The San Antonio Spurs remained undefeated in their 106 - 99 win over the host Miami Heat on Sunday at American Airlines Center . In a game that was tight throughout , the more veteran squad prevailed . San Antonio ( 40 ) dominated the shooting , as it hit 56 percent of its three - pointers and 86 percent of its free - throws . Despite tying in defensive rebounds , San Antonio was able to win the offensive rebounding margin 14 - 6 . Miami ( 1 - 2 ) did dominate down low , though , outscoring the Spurs 46 - 32 in the paint . Another key for the Spurs was their ability to score off turnovers , as they won that battle 21 points to 10 . Kawhi Leonard was the star for the Spurs once again , tallying 27 points and six assists . The reigning two - time Defensive Player of the Year scored the final 10 points for the Spurs and accumulated 16 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter . Pau Gasol was the only other starter in double figures , totaling 20 points and 11 rebounds in his first double - double of the year . In fact , their three other starters combined for just 16 points in the win . Patty Mills did provide 18 points off the bench but failed to record any other fantasy - relevant stats in 25 minutes of action . Four Heat players scored in double figures in their loss , but no one else did much of anything . In fact , the other five players combined for just 17 points . Hassan Whiteside carried the load for the Heat , contributing 27 points , 15 rebounds and four blocks in the loss . Goran Dragic was second - highest scorer , adding 25 points of his own , while adding five assists and three boards . Justise Winslow had a nice game , as well , totaling 18 points and five rebounds . Tyler Johnson was the only bench player to score more than two points , as he chipped in 12 in 30 minutes of play . Both teams return to action on Tuesday , as the Spurs host the Utah Jazz and the Heat host the Sacramento Kings .
The Wizards erased a 54 - 49 halftime deficit with a third - quarter rally that saw them outscore their visitors by a 38 - 23 margin . Both teams exceeded the 51 - percent mark from the field , with Nicolas Batum ( 20 points ) and John Wall ( 25 points , 10 assists ) leading the way , respectively . The two clubs had trouble taking care of the ball , as evidenced by a combined 32 turnovers . For the Hornets , Kemba Walker had a near - double - double with 17 points and nine assists . Michael Kidd-Gilchrist contributed 11 points , and Marco Belinelli paced the bench with 16 points . Wall also contributed seven steals , but offset them with eight turnovers . Bradley Beal ( 20 points ) , Marcin Gortat ( 16 - point , 12 - rebound double - double ) and spot starter Kelly Oubre , Jr. ( 15 points ) were very productive . Jason Smith came off the bench to produce 12 points in 18 minutes .
The New York Knicks ( 9 - 10 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 1 - 19 ) 99 - 85 on Wednesday at Madison Square Garden in New York . After securing their first win of the season on Tuesday , the Sixers were hoping to get their momentum moving in the right direction . Unfortunately , that was n't the case Wednesday , as the Knicks came in and snapped a four - game losing streak of their own with the 14 - point victory over the Sixers.The Sixers forced the Knicks into 17 turnovers as a team , but could n't get anything going offensively , shooting just 37 percent from the field and 32 percent from the three - point line . Conversely , the Knicks shot 44 percent from the floor and 20 percent from deep . It was Kristaps Porzingis , the Knicks ' electrifying first - round pick , who again stole the show Wednesday . Porzingis was very efficient offensively , scoring a team - high of 17 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 2 - 2 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) , to go along with 10 rebounds and four blocked shots . He 's now notched two double - doubles in a row , which brings his season total to nine . Porzingis is averaging 14 points , 9 rebounds and 2 blocks on the season . After missing Sunday 's game due to an illness , superstar Carmelo Anthony returned to the lineup . Anthony did n't have the best game shooting the ball , but still finished with 12 points ( 5 - 16 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) , while also adding six rebounds and a pair of assists . Anthony has combined to shoot just 9 - for - 29 from the field and 1 - for - 6 from the three - point line over his last two games , so he 'll look to turn things around moving forward . Arron Afflalo chipped in with 13 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt ) and eight rebounds as well . With Jahlil Okakor being suspended two games due to a few off - court incidents , the Sixers had JaKarr Sampson move into the starting lineup . Sampson led all Sixer scorers with 12 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) , to go along with five rebounds over 23 minutes . The 12 points were the most he 's scored since the season opener , considering he 's averaging just 6 points and 3 rebounds on the season . Sampson should get the start again Saturday with Okafor remaining out on suspension . Hollis Thompson and Richaun Holmes came off the bench and tried to give the Sixers a much - needed spark . Thompson recorded 13 points ( 5 - 12 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt ) and four rebounds , while Holmes added 11 points ( 4 - 6 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and three rebounds . The Knicks ' next game will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Friday , while the Sixers will head home to play the Denver Nuggets on Saturday .
The Indiana Pacers ( 6 - 8 ) defeated the Dallas Mavericks ( 10 - 5 ) 111 - 100 on Monday at the American Airlines Center in Dallas . After coming into Saturday on a six game win streak , the Mavericks have now lost two straight games , with the Pacers being the latest to serve them a loss . The Pacers were able to shoot 50 percent from the three - point line and out - rebound the Mavericks 44 - 37 to help them steal the victory on the road . The Pacers win stems from a big night by Donald Sloan . Sloan shot an outstanding 10 - for - 14 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 29 points . He also converted on 6 - of - 9 attempts from the free throw line , adding to his point total . It was only his second game of the season scoring over the 20 - point mark . Luis Scola also was able to have a productive night against the Mavericks . He scored 14 points ( 4 - 11 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 5 - 6 FT ) and grabbed 11 rebounds . He 's now grabbed double - digit rebounds in three of the last four games he 's played in . With Roy Hibbert sitting out with an injury , Ian Mahinmi got his first start at center on the season and was able to post 10 points and seven rebounds . It was his second game in a row reaching double figures in points , after not scoring more than nine points previously this year . Despite the loss , the Mavericks still had plenty of offensive production from their starters . Monta Ellis shot 9 - for - 19 from the field and 1 - for - 5 from beyond the arc to score 24 points , while also handing out six assists . He 's averaging 20 points and 5 assists on the season . Dirk Nowitzki also had one of his better offensive games of late . He shot 9 - for - 17 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 22 points . He also had 11 rebounds , marking his second double - double of the season . Chandler Parsons and Jameer Nelson were also able to reach double figures in points with 16 and 10 points respectively . The team overall just did n't have their usual defensive presence to keep the Pacers from getting the victory . The Pacers ' next game will be on the road against the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday , while the Mavericks will be at home against the New York Knicks on Wednesday .
The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Miami Heat , 93 - 90 , at American Airlines Arena on Tuesday . Despite the victory , the Hawks ( 8 - 2 ) did not get off to the best start against a depleted Heat ( 2 - 8 ) squad . Atlanta struggled to get a lead over Miami and did n't pull ahead until there was just over two minutes left in the second period . From there , it was a game of runs as the teams traded leads before the Hawks were able to hold off one last push of desperation by Miami . Atlanta did , however , lose Dwight Howard late in the third quarter , as he left the game with a left quad contusion and did not return . He did still manage to finish with a double - double of 11 points and 11 rebounds in just 25 minutes . In the end , Dennis Schroder led the way for Atlanta , scoring 18 points and dishing out four assists , while Paul Millsap , who ended up playing a solid dose of minutes at the center position , posted 15 points , six rebounds , four assists and two steals Tuesday night . For the Heat , it was yet another dominant performance from center Hassan Whiteside , who finished with 19 points and 25 rebounds en route to his ninth double - double of the season . Josh Richardson matched Whiteside 's 19 points in 38 minutes , as he looks to be fully healthy after missing the start of the season with a knee injury . Dion Waiters , however , who is filling in as the team 's starting point guard with Goran Dragic ( ankle ) out , struggled from the field , shooting 5 - of - 18 and scoring just 11 points . Justise Winslow also missed Tuesday 's game with a wrist injury . Up next , the Hawks will look to keep rolling at home against Milwaukee on Wednesday , while the Heat will look to turn things around against the Bucks on Thursday .
The Sacramento Kings defeated the Denver Nuggets , 120 - 113 , at Pepsi Center on Tuesday . In a battle between two teams battling for the eight - seed in the west , the Kings were able to prevail with a big road win . An 18 - 2 run in the second quarter was the decisive stretch for Sacramento , as they never relinquished their lead after that big run . Turnovers really killed Denver , as they committed 14 of them , while forcing just eight from the Kings . Sacramento shot 52 percent from the field , with Denver shooting 48 percent on their end . Sacramento ( 15 - 19 ) have n't had many road wins to celebrate this season , but this won catapulted them into playoff positioning for the time being . DeMarcus Cousins was once again the catalyst for the Kings , as he accumulated 31 points , six rebounds and six assists . Darren Collison had one of his best games of the season , tallying 26 points and seven assists . Kosta Koufos was the only other starter in double figures , scoring 18 points on 8 - of - 9 shooting . Arron Afflalo punished his former team with 19 points on 8 - of - 10 shooting off the bench . The Kings will play again on Wednesday , when they host the injury - riddled Miami Heat . Denver ( 14 - 21 ) had to play this game in the second half of a back - to - back set and they clearly were hampered by that fact in this loss . Danilo Gallinari did all he could for the Nuggets , leading the team with 24 points , four rebounds and three assists on 8 - of - 12 from the field . Nikola Jokic continued his recent surge , collecting 18 points , seven rebounds and five assists . Jusuf Nurkic was a nice spark off the bench , accruing 16 points , six rebounds and four assists . Things do n't get any easier for Denver , as they play the San Antonio Spurs for their next game on Thursday .
The grit - and - grind Memphis Grizzlies ( 44 - 17 ) took home the 97 - 90 win over the Los Angeles Lakers ( 16 - 45 ) on Friday . The Grizzlies are 5 - 3 since returning from the All-Star break , doing enough to stay nestled between the Western Conference-leading Golden State Warriors and the third - place Portland Trial Blazers for second place in West playoff standings . Zach Randolph led the way with a team - high 24 points and 13 rebounds in 37 minutes to help the Grizzlies put a bowtie on their season series with the Lakers , having won all four matchups . Rookie point guard Jordan Clarkson scored a career - high 25 points , but after he made a two - point field goal to put the Lakers up 75 - 67 with 11 minutes left in the game , Grizzlies coach Dave Joerger put Tony Allen on the rookie , and the Grizzlies roared back , with Clarkson bottled up so bad that he only got off two more shots the rest of the way and missed both of them . Still trailing 87 - 86 with 1:50 left in the game , Jeff Green stole the ball on a bad pass from Jordan Hill , and Green ended up being fouled , which sent him to the line to knock down both of his free throws and give the Grizzlies the lead they would never relinquish . Memphis will travel to New Orleans to play the Pelicans on Saturday , and the Lakers will return home to host the Mavericks on Sunday , when they will try to stop their four - game skid .
It was a big night for the Sacramento Kings as they earned their fourth straight win . Center DeMarcus Cousins in particular scored in droves , shooting 13 - of - 24 for 40 points on the night . Cousins added 12 rebounds and eight assists and went 12 - of - 19 at the free - throw line . An edge in free - throws made a big difference for the Kings . Sacramento shot 18 - of - 25 from the line , while LA was just 8 - of - 15 . The Kings also shot a stellar 49 percent from the field . Los Angeles , meanwhile , poured in a respectable 12 three - pointers . Four of those came from sixth man Lou Williams , who exploded for 29 points and five assists . Highly-touted rookie Brandon Ingram , meanwhile , struggled , scoring just seven points on 2 - of - 7 shooting and 1 - of - 4 at the free - throw line . The Lakers still managed to shoot 45 percent as a team .
The Golden State Warriors defeated the Milwaukee Bucks , 117 - 92 , at Oracle Arena on Saturday . Golden State were expected to win this game easily and they left no doubt with this 25 - point result . The second quarter is where they separated themselves from Milwaukee , as they won that quarter , 36 - 15 . Golden State actually led by at least 18 points for the entirety of the second half , thanks to that run . The shooting statistics were lopsided , with Golden State hitting 60 percent of their shots to Milwaukee 's 40 percent . Defensive rebounding really helped the Warriors too , as they outrebounded the Bucks , 38 - 23 . The Bucks ( 34 - 35 ) had won eight of nine headed into this matchup , but facing the Warriors is a different animal . Michael Brogdon led the team with 18 points , four rebounds and three assists . Khris Middleton totaled just 11 points and five assists , Greg Monroe led the bench with 12 points and seven rebounds . Giannis Antetokounmpo had one of his worst games of the season , collecting just nine points , three rebounds and three assists . Milwaukee 's next game wo n't be until Tuesday , when they take on the Portland Trail Blazers on the road .

Stephen Curry led Golden State , as he accrued 28 points , four rebounds , four assists and three steals . Klay Thompson finished second on the team , dropping 21 points . Draymond Green flirted with a triple - double , accumulating eight points , eight rebounds and 10 assists . Andre Iguodala was a huge spark off the bench , providing 15 points , four rebounds , four assists and two blocks . Golden State 's next game will be on Monday , when they face the Oklahoma City Thunder on the road .
The New Orleans Pelicans ( 25 - 42 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 26 - 41 ) 123 - 108 at Sleep Train Arena on Wednesday . Anthony Davis and Ryan Anderson put on a scoring clinic in the blowout , as both players took advantage of their matchups against the struggling Kings . Sacramento is 1 - 9 over their last 10 games and the team has fallen off the wagon since the all - star break . Anthony Davis got off to a strong start and dominated in the second quarter , where his team ended the half with a 21 point lead . Davis scored 27 points and grabbed 14 rebounds on 10 - of - 20 shooting , while Ryan Anderson was lethal in 26 minutes off the bench and finished with 29 points that included five baskets from behind the arc . Omer Asik has received sporadic minutes over the last few games , but earned the starting nod on Wednesday after not playing any minutes on Monday . Asik contributed a lowly five points , to go along with four rebounds in the unimpressive performance . New Orleans shot selection was all but unstoppable for Sacramento , as they shot 54 percent as a unit . The Kings look monotonous since dropping off in the playoff chase , and their struggle on the defensive end of the floor has opened up blowout losses . They entered the game without the depth of Rajon Rondo ( thumb/shoulder ) and Marco Belinelli ( ankle ) , which posed major mismatches in the backcourt . The help defense at the rim was also absent , save for DeMarcus Cousins doing whatever he can to keep his team in the game . Cousins finished with 20 points , 12 rebounds , five assists and two blocks on 8 - of - 21 shooting , while Darren Collison impressed on the offensive end with 23 points , which included a perfect 3 - of - 3 from deep . After the brutal second quarter , the Kings bounced back in the third quarter and chipped six points off lead , but it was far from enough to bring the game close enough to compete . Both teams play on Friday , as the Kings will visit the Detroit Pistons ( 34 - 34 ) , while the Pelicans will host the Damian Lillard and the Portland Trail Blazers ( 35 - 33 ) .
This was one of the tightest games of the season , as neither team led by more than seven points . In total , there were nine ties and 14 lead changes , as it came down to the final seconds . Defense was key for Miami , as they held Indiana to 37 percent shooting and just 10 points in the fourth quarter . The Heat also dominated the rebounding and assists , winning the rebounding , 58 - 38 , and the assists , 23 - 14 . Paul George was the only Indiana player with more than 15 points , as he tallied 22 points , seven rebounds and three assists in the defeat . Myles Turner totaled 11 points , seven rebounds and five blocks . Hassan Whiteside was the player of the game , as he amassed 26 points and 22 rebounds in the win . The Johnson duo was huge off the bench for Miami , as Tyler Johnson and James Johnson combined for 29 points , eight rebounds and nine assists .
The Detroit Pistons ( 15 - 12 ) defeated the Boston Celtics ( 14 - 12 ) Wednesday 119 - 116 at The Palace in Auburn Hills in Detroit . The teams went wire - to - wire , exchanging blow after blow in the second half . However , with just over two minutes to go in the game , the Pistons were able to open up a seven - point lead that the Celtics were simply unable to come back from . For Detroit , it was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope 's night , as the shooting guard out of Georgia scored a team - high 31 points in 44 minutes while shooting 10 - of - 16 from the field . Reggie Jackson also had an efficient night , scoring 23 points in just 28 minutes , while Andre Drummond recorded yet another double - double , finishing with 16 points and 12 rebounds in 35 minutes . The Pistons ' starting five carried the team the whole night , as they managed to score 92 of the teams 119 points . For the Celtics , they got a career - night from point guard Isaiah Thomas , who finished with a career - high 38 points and seven assists in 38 minutes .

The Brooklyn Nets ( 10 - 23 ) defeated the Boston Celtics ( 18 - 15 ) 100 - 97 on Saturday . Brooklyn , which had only three road victories this season , got a rare road win against the Celtics . The Nets largely accomplished their unlikely feat by going through the weak spot of the Celtics ' otherwise formidable defense , the frontcourt . As has often been the case this season , Brook Lopez and Thaddeus Young dominated down low with a pair of double - double efforts . Lopez led all scorers with a season - high 30 points , and added 13 rebounds , two assists , a steal and a block for his sixth double - double in the last seven games . Meanwhile , Young contributed 16 points , 10 boards , an assist and a steal . The Nets impressively scored almost half of their points in the paint , collecting 46 near the basket on the afternoon , and also hauled in 50 rebounds . While Boston matched them in scoring down low and actually bested them by one board in the latter category , Lopez 's mammoth offensive showing played an integral role in allowing Brooklyn to escape with a hard - fought victory . Veteran Joe Johnson was the third Brooklyn starter to turn in a notable effort , posting 20 points on 9 of 19 shooting . It was somewhat of a breakout game for the 15 - year veteran , who had not eclipsed the 20 - point mark since Dec. 8 against the Rockets , and who was also coming off three straight single - digit scoring outings . Bojan Bogdanovic contributed a solid 13 points and six rebounds , while Jarrett Jack , who was only able to muster two points but who did dish out nine assists , exited the game late in the third quarter with what is believed to be a right knee sprain at a minimum . Jack 's right leg appeared to buckle on a fast break opportunity , and the Nets will hold out hope for the best with respect to their veteran point guard . The Nets improved to 10 - 23 but remain in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They now head home to face this same Celtics squad Monday in the second game of the teams ' home - and - home series . The Celtics struggled to find the basket all afternoon , particularly from long range . They could only manage 39 and 22 percent metrics , respectively , from the field and beyond the arc . Isaiah Thomas did lead the way with a solid 24 points , six assists , two rebounds and two steals over 36 minutes , and shot a respectable 10 - for - 22 . However , Thomas could only drain two of the nine three - point shots he attempted , and missed a 27 - footer with 14 seconds left that would have closed the Boston deficit to three at the time . The dependable Jae Crowder did pick up a technical for a scuffle with Jack , but also put up 16 points and hauled in seven boards . He also handed out three assists and recorded a pair of steals . While the other three starters could only muster single - digit scoring , Amir Johnson did supplement his seven points with 11 rebounds . Evan Turner and Marcus Smart paced the Boston reserves , who scored 41 as a group , with 12 and 11 points , respectively . Turner added seven rebounds and three assists , while Smart pitched in with three boards , an assist and three steals . Two of Smart 's thefts came in the final 19 seconds , but the Celtics were only able to convert those into two points in the form of a Turner field goal off the rebound of Thomas ' aforementioned three - point miss . Boston fell to 18 - 15 but remains in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They hit the road to for another go - around with the Nets at the Barclays Center on Monday .

Utah hung tough with Portland and made things very interesting when Joe Ingles ' three pointer brought the Jazz within two points with just under 10 seconds to go in the game .

He did a little bit of everything in this game , nearing a triple - double with seven rebounds and seven assists as well .

He did n't near his season average of 20 points per game , but he was still effective enough to help secure the victory . Tony Allen had 14 points ( 6 - 8 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) of his own . More importantly though , Allen had a huge defensive effort in this one , posting a season - high of seven steals . The only other player to reach double figures was Courtney Lee , who had 11 points in 26 minutes . The Knicks were still without Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire , which continued to limit their offensive abilities . Quincy Acy led the team in a surprise performance off the bench . He went 7 - for - 8 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score 19 points . He had only reached double figures three other times this season , making it even more impressive for the young forward . He also got it done on the boards though , posting a season - high of 14 rebounds . It marked his first double - double of the year .

Tim Hardaway Jr seemingly struggled to get in a groove and finished with 12 points ( 4 - 14 FG , 2 - 8 3Pt , 2 - 4 FT ) in 33 minutes . The Grizzlies ' next game will be on the road against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday , while the Knicks will travel to Washington to play the Wizards on Wednesday .
When the worst offense faces the worst defense , 29 - point games are the outcome . Golden State were unstoppable on offense , as they sjhot 63 percent from the field and 67 percent from three - point range . Much of that has to be attributed to ball movement , as they recorded 37 assists on 49 buckets . Eric Bledsoe did all he could to keep the Suns hanging around , as he accumulated 27 points , five rebounds , four assists and five steals in the defeat . The Splash Brothers ( Stephen Curry , Klay Thompson ) were on display for Golden State , as they combined for 57 points , going 11 - of - 14 from three - point range . Kevin Durant was n't too shabby either , totaling 20 points , four rebounds and eight assists . Draymond Green 's nine points and five rebounds do n't look great , but he handed out a game - high 13 assists , making numerous hustle plays with the game well out of hand .

Behind a very impressive shooting performance as a team , the Wizards were able to finish the series sweep of the Raptors , as they eliminated them from the playoffs Sunday with the win . The Wizards got off to an extremely quick start , shooting 71 percent from the field and 60 percent from the three - point line in the first quarter to secure a 14 - point lead . They carried that momentum into the second and pushed themselves up by 16 points at the break . The Wizards never let off the gas and at one point led by 36 points , as the Raptors just did n't have an answer for the Wizards ' offense . The Wizards had seven players reach double figures in points in this one , receiving a nice effort from their bench to go along with some other impressive performances between the starters . Bradley Beal led the way with 23 points ( 5 - 15 FG , 3 - 6 3Pt , 10 - 11 FT ) , while also adding five assists and four steals . Beal was one of the big reasons for the quick start considering he had eight points at the end of the first quarter and 15 points by halftime . Beal has had a big post - season thus far , averaging 21 points over his first four contests . John Wall got off to a hot start as well though and finished the game with 14 points ( 3 - 5 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt , 7 - 7 FT ) and 10 assists . He could 've put up some much higher numbers , but he was limited to just 25 minutes due to the huge lead the Wizards had early on in the game . Coming up with a surprise performance was Marcin Gortat , as he posted 21 points ( 8 - 9 FG , 5 - 7 FT ) and 11 rebounds over 29 minutes . After not doing too much in the first two games of this series , he really picked it up over the last two , combining for 45 points and 24 rebounds during that stretch , while notching two double - doubles in a row . Drew Gooden and Ramon Sessions received extra time off the bench with the lead . Gooden added 13 points ( 5 - 8 FG , 3 - 4 3Pt ) and four rebounds , while Sessions had 15 points ( 5 - 7 FG , 3 - 4 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and three assists . After struggling during the start of the playoffs , Kyle Lowry finally found some production for the Raptors . He went 8 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score 21 points , while also adding eight rebounds and four assists . He did turn the ball over six times though and received a technical for throwing the ball in frustration at the referee , so Lowry did n't necessarily have the type of success that he had hoped coming into the 2015 NBA Playoffs and he ends his season in disappointing fashion . Jonas Valanciunas nearly recorded a double - double with 16 points ( 7 - 10 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) and nine rebounds . It was a solid end to the season for Valanciunas , who averaged 12 points and 9 rebounds during the regular season . Both DeMar DeRozan and Louis Williams reached double figures as well . DeRozan finished with 14 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) , four assists and three steals , while Williams chipped in with 14 points ( 4 - 11 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) and one rebound . The Raptors just could n't keep up with the Wizards ' shooting as Toronto finished at just 44 percent from the field and a meager 28 percent from deep . The Wizards will now have to wait to see who wins the Atlanta Hawks/Brooklyn Nets series in order to find out who they 'll play next . The Hawks currently lead that matchup 2 - 1 .

Fastbreak points and scoring in the paint were a huge difference as well , combining to win those categories , 70 - 36 .

The subject of trade rumors and victim to a notable slump for most of January , Jeff Teague 's 2016 had n't exactly gotten off to the best of starts . However , the 27 - year - old point guard had slowly begun crawling his way back to prominence over the four games prior to Monday , averaging a solid 16 points per contest during that span . Monday 's matchup against a Mavericks defense that had struggled against point guards this season proved to be the final domino to fall in Teague 's resurgence , as he managed a season - high 32 points , and complemented them with eight assists , five rebounds and a steal over 28 highly efficient minutes . Having totaled a modest 12 points in the first half as Atlanta built a 53 - 46 lead , Teague tallied 13 points in the third quarter alone , helping the home team emerge from the period with a commanding 86 - 73 lead they would n't surrender .

In just his second game in a Heat uniform , Johnson paced the starting unit with 24 points , and added five rebounds , four assists and a block , his second performance of 20 points or more in two games in South Florida .

They head up the road to Orlando for an encounter with the Magic on Wednesday night . With such a prolific showing , the Heat naturally had plenty to be pleased about on the stat sheet . Hassan Whiteside continued to show that perhaps coming off the bench is what best suits him , as he once again paced Miami with a 26 - point , 14 - rebound effort that also included an assist and four blocks . It was notably the sixth straight double - double in his six post - All - Star - break games , all in a reserve role . Johnson was next with his aforementioned 24 - point haul , and he also posted five rebounds , four assists and a block .
